<div class="c58" id="doeswellsfargorequireapropertyinspection" data-cid="tcm:84-23202-16" data-ctid="tcm:91-6213-32">
		<h3 class="c58question">Does Wells Fargo require a property inspection?</h3>	
		<div class="c58answer"><p>If you're buying a home, it's highly recommended that you obtain a property inspection and make your purchase offer contingent on the findings of the inspection.</p>
<p>There is a difference between a property inspection and an appraisal. An appraisal is required by most mortgage lenders in order to support the value of the real estate and the terms of the mortgage agreement.</p></div>
	</div><div class="c58" id="doineedanattorney" data-cid="tcm:84-23203-16" data-ctid="tcm:91-6213-32">
		<h3 class="c58question">Do I need an attorney?</h3>	
		<div class="c58answer"><p>While there are many areas of the country where attorneys are not typically used in real estate transactions, some states do require an attorney. If you're not sure of the state requirements, you can check with your home mortgage consultant.</p></div>
	</div>
        <div class="c58" id="whatistheminimumdownpaymentforconventionalfhaandvaloans" data-cid="tcm:84-177530-16" data-ctid="tcm:91-6213-32">
		<h3 class="c58question">What is the minimum down payment for conventional, FHA, and VA loans?</h3>	
		<div class="c58answer"><p>Wells Fargo offers several low down payment options, including conventional loans (those not backed by a government agency).</p>
<ul>
<li>Conventional fixed-rate loans are available with a <a href="https://www.wellsfargo.com/mortgage/loan-programs/low-down-payment/">down payment as low as 3%</a>.
<ul>
<li>Keep in mind that with a low down payment mortgage insurance will be required, which increases the cost of the loan and will increase your monthly payment. We'll explain the options available, so you can choose what works for you.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Talk with a home mortgage consultant about loan amount, loan type, property type, income, first-time homebuyer, and homebuyer education requirements to ensure eligibility.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wellsfargo.com/mortgage/loan-programs/fha-va-loans/">FHA loans</a> are available with as little as 3.5% down.
<ul>
<li>FHA loans have the benefit of a low down payment, but you'll want to consider all costs involved, including up-front and long-term mortgage insurance and all fees. Be certain to ask your home mortgage consultant to help you compare the overall costs of all your home financing options.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wellsfargo.com/mortgage/loan-programs/fha-va-loans/">VA loans</a> offer low- and no-down-payment options for eligible veterans and other eligible borrowers.</li>
</ul></div>

<div class="c58" id="howdoiknowifmymortgageisassumable" data-cid="tcm:84-131864-16" data-ctid="tcm:91-6213-32">
		<h3 class="c58question">How do I know if my mortgage is assumable?</h3>	
		<div class="c58answer"><p>Not all mortgages are assumable, but you can tell if you have one by the language in your note and mortgage.  You can also find out by speaking to one of our assumption specialists at <span class="c12">1-800-340-0570</span>.</p>
<p>If you have an existing assumable mortgage, you may be able to add or remove borrower(s) through an assumption loan.</p>
<p>Common reasons for an assumption loan include divorce, legal separation, death, or direct purchase. In these situations, it may make sense to get an assumption loan instead of a traditional purchase or refinance if the terms of the existing mortgage are more favorable than those of a new loan.</p>
<p><strong>Potential benefits:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>May enhance the property's marketability, especially if interest rates are rising</li>
<li>May not need a new appraisal, lender title policy, survey, and inspection</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There are fees to assume a loan, including closing costs that must be paid separately from the mortgage.</li>
<li>The buyer or person assuming the loan must meet credit and income qualifications and provide requested documentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information or to determine eligibility, call the Wells Fargo Assumption Department at <span class="c12">1-800-340-0570</span>.</p></div>

		<h3 class="c58question">How are interest rates determined?</h3>	
		<div class="c58answer"><p>Interest rates are influenced by the financial markets and can change daily – or multiple times within the same day.

		<h3 class="c58question">If I've already been preapproved for a mortgage loan by Wells Fargo, how long does it typically take to close?</h3>	
		<div class="c58answer"><p>The number of days from application to approval will vary for purchase and refinance home loans. The timeline is generally 30-90 days.</p></div>

		<h3 class="c58question">If I have a Wells Fargo mortgage and want to refinance, will I have to pay closing costs again?</h3>	
		<div class="c58answer"><p>Yes. There are costs related to processing any new loan application; they can include fees paid to third parties, such as an appraiser, the title company, and other closing expenses.</p></div>
	</div>
        <div class="c58" id="whatisanoriginationcharge" data-cid="tcm:84-23191-16" data-ctid="tcm:91-6213-32">
		<h3 class="c58question">What is an origination charge?</h3>	
		<div class="c58answer"><p>The origination charge is the amount charged for services performed on the initial loan application and loan processing. This includes all charges (other than discount points) that lenders and brokers involved in the transaction will receive for originating the loan. It includes any fees for application, processing, underwriting services, and payments from the lender for origination. <a href="https://www.wellsfargo.com/mortgage/learning/closing-costs/">Learn more about closing costs</a></p></div>

		<div class="c58answer"><p>Home equity is what's available after subtracting what you owe on your mortgage (and any other outstanding liens) from your home's current market value. If you don't own a home and need financing, look into a personal loan that doesn't rely on home equity.</p></div>

		<div class="c58answer"><p>The amount you can borrow is largely determined by your available equity, property type, and credit qualifications. To determine your available equity for a primary residence, take 80% of your home's appraised or fair market value and subtract the balances of any outstanding mortgages and liens on the property. If you qualify, the minimum home equity line of credit amount is $25,000 and in most cases the maximum is $500,000.</p></div>

<p><strong>Terms:</strong> The line of credit has a draw period of 10 years plus 1 month, after which you will no longer have access to borrow funds and will be required to repay the borrowed balance within a 20-year term. There is a required minimum monthly payment of $100. The account is subject to application, credit qualification, and income verification; additional evaluation and verification criteria may apply. Your actual APR will depend upon your credit transaction and credit history and will be determined when a credit decision is made. For questions, please contact us at <span class="c12">1-800-668-4730</span>.</p>
<p><strong>APR and fees:</strong> The APR for a Wells Fargo home equity line of credit is variable and based on the highest prime rate published in the Western edition of <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> "Money Rates" table (called the "Index") plus a margin. The index as of the last change date of March 16, 2020, is 3.25%. As of April 24, 2020, margins range from 4.250% to -0.225% for lines of credit from $25,000 to $500,000 secured by owner-occupied properties with 70% combined loan-to-value. Corresponding variable APRs range from 7.500% to 3.025%. The minimum line of credit amount is $25,000. Your minimum APR, including discounts, can't go below the 1% floor rate. Your variable rate won't increase more than 2% per year based on your anniversary date and will never be more than 7% higher than where you started (maximum of 18%).</p>
<p>There is no annual fee or prepayment penalty fee. Wells Fargo will pay account-opening fees unless an account opening fee-related service is requested by the customer and not required by Wells Fargo. Payment for homeowners insurance and, if applicable, flood insurance is required and must be paid by the customer.</p>
<p><strong>Relationship discounts:</strong> If you don't have an eligible account at the time you open your home equity line of credit, other discounts may be available to you and will require automatic payments from a qualified consumer deposit account. Contact a Wells Fargo banker for details. Relationship discounts cannot be combined.</p>
