<p><strong>Note:</strong> Fees may apply for payments made through third parties such as MoneyGram and Western Union.</p></div>

        <div class="c58" id="howisinterestcalculatedonmyautoloan" data-cid="tcm:84-194333-16" data-ctid="tcm:91-6213-32">
		<h3 class="c58question">How is interest calculated on my auto loan?</h3>	
		<div class="c58answer"><p>With a simple interest loan, interest accrues daily. As you pay off the <a href="https://www.wellsfargo.com/help/loans/auto-loans-faqs/" id="bc1689df-3f1a-4dbf-81d1-a14076a01a21" data-content-id="8419422216" data-cid="tcm:84-194222-16" data-ctid="tcm:91-2806-32" class="c29link">principal balance</a>, the daily interest charge will decrease.</p>
<p>To calculate the daily interest charge, first convert the interest rate percentage into a decimal by dividing the interest rate by 100. Multiply that number by your principal balance, and then divide by the number of days in a year (365 or 366 for a leap year). This will give you the daily interest charge.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>
<br />
If the loan has a 9% interest rate and a $10,000 principal balance, you convert the interest rate into a decimal: 9 / 100 = .09, and calculate the daily interest charge: .09 x $10,000 / 365 = $2.47 daily interest.

        <div class="c58" id="whatisasimpleinterestloan" data-cid="tcm:84-194334-16" data-ctid="tcm:91-6213-32">
		<h3 class="c58question">What is a simple interest loan?</h3>	
		<div class="c58answer"><p>Simple interest is a method of allocating monthly loan payments between interest and principal. The amount of your payment allocated to interest is calculated based on your unpaid <a href="https://www.wellsfargo.com/help/loans/auto-loans-faqs/" id="bc1689df-3f1a-4dbf-81d1-a14076a01a21" data-content-id="8419422216" data-cid="tcm:84-194222-16" data-ctid="tcm:91-2806-32" class="c29link">principal balance</a>, the interest rate on your loan, and the number of days since your last payment.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>
<br />
If we receive a payment and it has been 29 days since your last payment, then you will be charged 29 days of interest on the unpaid principal balance of your loan. The remainder of your payment is credited to principal and reduces the unpaid principal balance on your loan.</p></div>
	</div>
<div class="c58" id="howmuchofmymonthlypaymentisinterest" data-cid="tcm:84-194335-16" data-ctid="tcm:91-6213-32">
		<h3 class="c58question">How much of my monthly payment is interest?</h3>	
		<div class="c58answer"><p>With a simple interest loan, there is a daily interest charge and you will pay interest on the number of days between your payments.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>
<br />
If the daily interest charge is $2.50, and it has been 30 days since your last payment was made, the interest due will be $75.00 ($2.50 x 30 days). Let’s use the same daily interest charge, but now say it has been 40 days since your last payment was made, the interest due will be $100.00 ($2.50 x 40 days).</p>
<p>If you defer a monthly payment, this will extend the term of your loan, and the interest will continue to accrue until the next payment is made. The outstanding loan balance will continue to accrue interest until the loan is paid off.</p>
<p>The total interest paid over the term of your loan may be different from what is shown on your loan agreement. If you pay your loan early, the amount of interest will be less, and if you pay your loan late, the amount of interest will be more.</p></div>
	</div>
        <div class="c58" id="whydoestheamountofinterestipaychangeeachmonth" data-cid="tcm:84-194336-16" data-ctid="tcm:91-6213-32">
		<h3 class="c58question">Why does the amount of interest I pay change each month?</h3>	
		<div class="c58answer"><p>The amount of interest paid each month changes because the daily interest amount decreases as the <a href="https://www.wellsfargo.com/help/loans/auto-loans-faqs/" id="bc1689df-3f1a-4dbf-81d1-a14076a01a21" data-content-id="8419422216" data-cid="tcm:84-194222-16" data-ctid="tcm:91-2806-32" class="c29link">principal balance</a> decreases.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the loan, the principal balance is higher, and as a result, the daily interest amount is higher. As you start paying down your principal balance, the amount of interest you pay each month decreases.</p>
<p>Additionally, interest accrues daily, and the number of days between payments makes a difference. More days between payments results in more days of interest charges, and fewer days between payments results in fewer days of interest charges.</p></div>

		<h3 class="c58question">How do I make a principal-only payment?</h3>	
		<div class="c58answer"><p>If you’d like to have additional funds applied to principal only, here are three ways to pay:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Automatic payments</strong> - <a href="https://connect.secure.wellsfargo.com/auth/login/present?origin=cob&amp;LOB=CONS" enrollmentid="2429">Sign on</a> and select your auto loan from Account Summary.

<li><strong>Mail</strong> - Note the additional principal amount using the payment coupon attached to your statement.</li>
<li><strong>Branch</strong> - Ask a Wells Fargo team member to apply the additional payment amount to the principal balance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: Principal-only payments won’t change the amount of your next payment or the due date. If you have incurred any late fees, the principal payment will be applied after any past due amounts and charges.</p></div>

		<h3 class="c58question">What happens if I miss a payment or make a late payment?</h3>	
		<div class="c58answer"><p>There may be a fee for missing a payment or making a late payment. You can find this information in your loan agreement. Since there is a daily interest charge on loans, more interest accrues when there are more days between payments. As a result, you may pay more interest over the life of the loan.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>
<br />
If the daily interest charge is $2.50, and it has been 30 days since your last payment was made, the interest due will be $75.00 ($2.50 x 30 days).</p>
<p>Let's use the same daily interest charge, but now say it has been 40 days since your last payment was made, the interest due will be $100.00 ($2.50 x 40 days).</p>

		<h3 class="c58question">When will I receive my title after I pay off my loan?</h3>	
		<div class="c58answer"><p>After we receive your final payment and the account balance is satisfied, we will release your title depending on the payoff method, state law requirements, and state motor vehicle department procedures. The title release process can vary in length and depends on if you have a paper, electronic, or customer-holding paper title. If you are unsure of which category applies to you, please contact your local motor vehicle department. If you have additional title-related questions, please call us at <span class="c12">1-888-329-4856</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Paper title maintained by Wells Fargo Auto</strong>
<br />
We start the title release process in approximately 3 – 10 calendar days after the payoff posts to your account, to allow enough processing time for your payment to clear through your financial institution, or as otherwise required by state law. To shorten the title release process, payment by guaranteed funds (such as a money order, cashier's check, or wire transfer) will begin the process within 3 calendar days.</p>
<p>Please note this does not include mail time.</p>
<p>If the payoff amount received does not satisfy the amount owed, the title will not be sent until the balance is settled. If you have additional title-related questions, please call us at <span class="c12">1-888-329-4856</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Electronic title maintained by your state</strong>
<br />
For electronic titles, you will not receive a paper title from Wells Fargo Auto. At the time of release, we will electronically cancel our lien with your state. After the lien is released, your state will mail your title in approximately 4 – 8 weeks.</p>
<p>Please note the states of Florida and Ohio do not automatically mail a paper title. You will need to contact the motor vehicle department to obtain the paper title if needed.</p>
<p>If you have not received the paper title from your state, please contact your motor vehicle department. If you have additional title-related questions, please call us at <span class="c12">1-888-329-4856</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Paper title maintained by customer</strong>
<br />
If requested, we will send a lien release to an individual or business authorized to receive it in those states where the customer maintains the title.</p></div>

Please note if you already have the paper title in hand or are waiting on the motor vehicle department to mail your paper title, you do not need a lien release.

		<div class="c58answer"><p>Begin by checking with your motor vehicle department to find out what title documentation you’ll need. (Requirements vary by state.) When we receive the request, we’ll send the title documentation in the appropriate format.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the motor vehicle department asks for <strong>a copy of the title</strong>, <strong>an electronic screen-print</strong>, <strong>or an authorization letter</strong>, you or the motor vehicle department can request that from us.</li>
<li>If the motor vehicle department needs <strong>the original paper title</strong>, they will need to request the title from us. (Converting an electronic title to a paper title could take up to 6 weeks, depending on motor vehicle department processing time.)</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll then go to the motor vehicle department to formally request the title change. The motor vehicle department will either send the information to us directly or will provide you with the required document. If you receive the document from the motor vehicle department, you can submit it to Wells Fargo Auto, along with one of the following documents:</p>
<ul>
<li>Articles of amendment</li>
<li>Certificate of domestic partnership</li>
<li>Certified court order</li>
<li>Death certificate (if removing someone from the title that is deceased)</li>
<li>Divorce decree</li>
<li>Motor vehicle department request</li>
<li>Marriage certificate</li>
<li>Notarized affidavit of same name statement</li>
<li>Petition for a name change</li>
<li>State-issued identification (such as driver's license or identification card)</li>

		<h3 class="c58question">What are aftermarket products?</h3>	
		<div class="c58answer"><p>Aftermarket products are optional products, services, or insurance that may be purchased when you buy your vehicle. They may cover unforeseen vehicle repair needs or assist with loan payments.</p>
<p>Common examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Guaranteed Asset Protection (GAP)</strong> pays all or a portion of the loan balance after the payment of a total loss insurance claim.</li>
<li><strong>Service contracts</strong> (also referred to as extended warranties) provide coverage in the event that a major mechanical component of the vehicle, such as engine, transmission, heating/cooling system, seals, gaskets, and fuel system, need repair. The coverage typically lasts for a specific period of time or vehicle mileage.</li>
<li><strong>Anti-theft protection</strong> includes devices or services, such as tracking, that make the vehicle more difficult to steal or easier to recover if it is stolen.</li>
<li><strong>Maintenance packages</strong> are prepaid plans that typically cover scheduled maintenance, such as oil changes, on the vehicle.</li>
<li><strong>Credit life insurance</strong> pays off all or some of your loan if you pass away.</li>
<li><strong>Credit disability insurance</strong> assists with making your loan payments if you become unable to do so due to disability.

		<div class="c58answer"><p>Refinancing your loan may affect aftermarket products, but it depends on the product you purchased.

 <h2>Guaranteed Asset Protection (GAP) coverage</h2>
<p><div class="c58" id="whatisguaranteedassetprotectiongap" data-cid="tcm:84-194385-16" data-ctid="tcm:91-6213-32">
		<h3 class="c58question">What is Guaranteed Asset Protection (GAP)?</h3>	
		<div class="c58answer"><p>GAP is an optional product that covers the "gap" between the amount owed on the loan and the vehicle’s value in the event of a total loss. Some exclusions apply. It is important to review the coverage details to understand the limitations to GAP coverage.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>
<br />
Your vehicle was in an accident and deemed a total loss. Your insurance company determines that the fair market value of the vehicle is $10,000, so that is what they paid out. The remaining loan balance on the vehicle is $13,000. After insurance, you still owe $3,000. If you have GAP, the remaining $3,000 may be covered.</p></div>
	</div>
        <div class="c58" id="isgapthesameasautoinsurance" data-cid="tcm:84-194386-16" data-ctid="tcm:91-6213-32">
		<h3 class="c58question">Is GAP the same as auto insurance?</h3>	
		<div class="c58answer"><p>No, GAP coverage only helps in the event of a total loss and is considered a supplement to your primary insurance. Car insurance covers the vehicle, while GAP covers the loan. Find out more about Guaranteed Asset Protection (GAP)</p></div>

<div class="c58" id="whydoesntgapcarryoverifirefinancemyloan" data-cid="tcm:84-194387-16" data-ctid="tcm:91-6213-32">
		<h3 class="c58question">Why doesn't GAP carry over if I refinance my loan?</h3>	
		<div class="c58answer"><p>GAP applies to a specific loan and typically is not transferable. If you refinance a loan that has GAP, you will likely lose the coverage. If you want GAP coverage on your new loan, you will need to purchase a new GAP policy.</p></div>

		<h3 class="c58question">How do I make payments on my auto loan account?</h3>	
		<div class="c58answer"><h4>Set up automatic payments</h4>
<p>You decide which savings or checking account you would like the money to come from each month. There is no charge for enrollment, and you can easily change or cancel the automatic payments online.</p>
<p>To set up automatic payments, download and complete the <a href="https://www.wellsfargo.com/assets/pdf/personal/help/ACHWebFormCCA.pdf" data-pdf="true" xmlns:tridion="http://www.tridion.com/ContentManager/5.0">automatic payment form (PDF)</a>, and return by mail.</p>
<h4>Pay online</h4>

Not enrolled in Wells Fargo Online<sup>®</sup>? <a href="https://oam.wellsfargo.com/oamo/identity/enrollment/" enrollmentid="2475">Enroll now</a></p>
<h4>Pay by phone</h4>
<p>Automated payment service is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.</p>
<h4>Pay by mail</h4>
<p>Make your check or money order payable to Wells Fargo Auto. Be sure to fill in all sections of a money order. (Do not send cash.) Write your account number on your check or money order. Mail your payment to:</p>
<p>Wells Fargo Auto

PO Box 51168
<br />
Los Angeles, CA 90051-5468</p>
<h4>Pay in person</h4>
<p>You can make payments at any Wells Fargo <a href="https://www.wellsfargo.com/locator/">banking location</a> at no charge, and a Wells Fargo account is not required.</p>
<h4>Other ways to pay</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>MoneyGram<sup>®</sup></strong> - Include your 17-digit Wells Fargo Auto account number and Receive Code <strong>2459</strong>. The company name is <strong>Wells Fargo Auto</strong>. Please note: third-party fees may apply.</li>
<li><strong>Western Union<sup>®</sup></strong> - Include your 17-digit Wells Fargo Auto account number, Western Union City Code <strong>WF Auto Finance</strong>, and State Code <strong>PA</strong>. Please note: third-party fees may apply.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Additional principal payments</h4>
<p>When you pay more than the total amount due, on or before the due date, the additional amount will pay down your principal balance and will be applied to your next payment due. You can pay your account up to three months in advance. Once the account is paid ahead three months, additional funds go toward principal only.</p>
<p>If you’d like to have additional funds applied to principal only, here are four ways to pay:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Automatic payments</strong> - Download and complete the <a href="https://www.wellsfargo.com/assets/pdf/personal/help/ACHWebFormCCA.pdf" data-pdf="true" xmlns:tridion="http://www.tridion.com/ContentManager/5.0">automatic payment form (PDF)</a>. Include the additional amount to be applied to principal, and return the form by mail.</li>
<li><strong>Online</strong> - <a href="https://connect.secure.wellsfargo.com/auth/login/present?origin=cob&amp;LOB=CONS">Sign on</a> to your account to make a payment, and select the principal payment option.</li>
<li><strong>Mail</strong> - Note the additional principal amount using the payment coupon attached to your statement.</li>
<li><strong>Branch</strong> - Ask a Wells Fargo team member to apply the additional payment amount to the principal balance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: Principal-only payments won’t change the amount of your next payment or the due date. If you have incurred any late fees, the principal payment will be applied after any past due amounts and charges.</p></div>
