		<h2 class="c58question">What is a FICO<sup  >®</sup> Score?</h2>	
		<div class="c58answer"><p  >FICO<sup>®</sup> Scores, created by the Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO), are the credit scores most widely used in lending decisions. Lenders can request FICO<sup>®</sup> Scores from all three major credit bureaus (Experian<sup>®</sup>, Equifax<sup>®</sup>, and Transunion<sup>®</sup>). FICO develops FICO<sup>®</sup> Scores based solely on information in consumer credit files maintained at the bureaus.</p> <p  >Please note that the score provided under this service is for educational purposes only and may not be the score used by Wells Fargo to make credit decisions. We may use other FICO<sup>®</sup> Score versions and other information when you apply for credit. There are many factors that Wells Fargo looks at to determine your credit options; therefore, a specific FICO<sup>®</sup> Score or Wells Fargo credit rating does not necessarily guarantee a specific loan rate, approval of a loan, or an automatic upgrade on a credit card. </p></div>

		<div class="c58answer"><p  >This FICO<sup>®</sup> Score is updated monthly, and you can expect to see your updated score on or around the same day each month. Scores reflect data from your credit file at the time it was calculated and may be from a previous period.</p></div>

		<h2 class="c58question">Why is this FICO<sup  >®</sup> Score different than other scores I’ve seen?</h2>	
		<div class="c58answer"><p  >While Wells Fargo uses FICO<sup>®</sup> Score 9 for some credit decisions, there are many different credit scores available to consumers and lenders. FICO<sup>®</sup> Scores are the credit scores used by most lenders, but different lenders (such as auto lenders and credit card lenders) may use different versions of FICO<sup>®</sup> Scores. Scores are pulled from a specific credit bureau on a certain date and reflect the information at the bureau as of that specific date. The differences in your credit files and the timing may create variations in your FICO<sup>®</sup> Scores. When reviewing a score, take note of the date, bureau credit file source, version, and range for that particular score.</p></div>

		<div class="c58answer"><p>If you feel information is inaccurate, your next step should be to review the details in your credit report. If there's incorrect information within your Experian credit report, you may want to submit a dispute directly with the lender or company that provided the information to the credit-reporting company. Include any documentation you have, such as copies of a canceled check or payment verification email. For questions about Wells Fargo accounts, <a href="../../../../help/contact-us/index.html" enrollmentid="0000" refplatform="newwindow">contact us</a> anytime.</p> <p>If the creditor investigates and agrees there was an error, they'll send an update to all the credit bureaus it reports to and have the late payment corrected or deleted. You can monitor your credit reports for the changes, which may take several billing cycles to appear.</p></div>

		<div class="c58answer"><p>The most common reasons a score may not be available:</p> <ul> <li>The credit report may not have enough information to generate a FICO<sup>®</sup> Score (at least one account must be reported in the past 6 months.)</li> <li>The credit bureau wasn't able to completely match your identity to your Wells Fargo Online<sup>®</sup> information.

		<h2 class="c58question">What is credit utilization?</h2>	
		<div class="c58answer"><p  >Credit utilization is the percentage of your credit limits that you're using. For example, if you have an account with a credit limit of $1,000 and your balance is $100, your credit utilization is 10%. Utilization is calculated for both your individual accounts and a total utilization rate on your revolving debt, like credit cards, and lines of credit. Most experts recommend trying to stay below 30% of your limit on any card, the lower the better, while still keeping your accounts active. Lenders view high credit utilization and "maxing out" credit cards as risky.</p></div>

		<h2 class="c58question">Does utilization matter if I pay my accounts in full each month?</h2>	
		<div class="c58answer"><p  >Sometimes. Typically, card issuers report your balances to the credit bureaus once per month, so your utilization ratio is based on what your balance is on that day. If you pay off the account the day after the balance is reported to the bureau, it would not be reflected on your credit report. Consider making frequent payments on your revolving accounts throughout the month. If you are able to keep your balance low throughout the billing cycle, you don't need to worry about the date your balance is reported to the bureau.</p></div>

		<h2 class="c58question">How is the age of my accounts calculated?</h2>	
		<div class="c58answer"><p  >Credit bureaus use the average age of all of your accounts. This accounts for 15% of your overall score. Keeping your accounts open and active helps you build the age of your credit file, and helps with credit utilization, which makes up 30% of your score.</p></div>

		<div class="c58answer"><p  >Keeping your accounts open, even if you don't use them often, can help build your credit history and contribute to your utilization ratio. You might consider closing an account, though, if it keeps you from charging up a high balance or to avoid an annual fee.</p></div>

		<div class="c58answer"><p  >If you are less than 30 days late, you may incur late fees on your account, but it will not show on your credit report. Once a payment is at least 30 days past due, it is reported delinquent and can damage your credit score. Credit-reporting agencies track how many times in the past seven years accounts are reported 30, 60, or 90 days late. To limit damage to your score, work to bring your account current as soon as you can and make all further payments on time.</p></div>

		<div class="c58answer"><p  >Your payment history is the biggest factor in your score, making up 35% of your FICO<sup>®</sup> Credit Score.

		<h2 class="c58question">Why do FICO<sup  >®</sup> Scores fluctuate?</h2>	
		<div class="c58answer"><p  >There are many reasons why your score may change. FICO<sup>®</sup> Scores are calculated each time they are requested, taking into consideration the information that is in your credit file from a particular consumer reporting agency at that time. </p> <p  >So, as the information in your credit file at that bureau changes, your FICO<sup>®</sup> Scores can also change. Review your key score factors, which help explain what factors from  your credit report most affected a score. Comparing key score factors from the two different time periods can help identify causes for changes in FICO<sup>®</sup> Scores. Keep in mind that certain events such as late payments or bankruptcy can lower your FICO<sup>®</sup> Scores quickly.</p></div>

Even if you later bring your account current, the payment you missed will remain in your credit history as a record of what happened.</p> <p  >Most negative information, late payments included, will be removed from your credit reports after seven years. Additionally, when a series of late payments leads to your account being closed, charged off, or transferred to a collection agency, the entire account will be removed seven years after the first missed payment that led up that status.
