<h3><a id="about-description" name="about-description"><span></span></a> 1(a). Description </h3>
<p>The Service is subject to this Agreement. The following are also considered part of this Agreement:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../privacy-security/terms/index.html" enrollmentid="0000">General Terms of Use</a> for the Website; and</li>
<li>Terms or instructions that appear on a screen when enrolling for, activating, accessing, or using the Service.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a id="about-other" name="about-other"><span></span></a> 1(b). Other Agreements with Us</h3>
<p>In addition to this Agreement, you may have a separate agreement with us for each of your Eligible Accounts and Online Financial Services. Those agreements will continue to apply to each of those accounts or services.</p>
<h3><a id="about-conflicts" name="about-conflicts"><span></span></a> 1(c). Conflicts Between Agreements</h3>
<p>If this Agreement conflicts with or is inconsistent with another agreement with us, then the other agreement will control and take precedence, unless this Agreement specifically states otherwise. The other agreement will only control with respect to the Eligible Account or Online Financial Service it is associated with, and only to the extent necessary to resolve the conflict or inconsistency. There are two exceptions to the general rule described above: If another agreement you have with us includes terms that address the Online Access Process, this Agreement will control and take precedence in resolving any inconsistencies between this Agreement and the terms in the other agreement that address the Online Access Process. Also, the original version of this Agreement is in the English language. Any discrepancy or conflicts between the English version and any other language version will be resolved with reference to and by interpreting the English version.</p>
<p>Trust and Investment Management Accounts are granted online access generally for view access only. Certain terms and conditions specified in this Agreement may not apply to Trust and Investment Management Accounts. To the extent there is a conflict between the terms and conditions of the agreements or applicable law governing Trust and Investment Accounts and this Agreement, the terms and conditions or applicable law governing the Trust and Investment Management Accounts control.</p></div>

<p>Each owner of an Eligible Account, Authorized Representative, and Delegate, will need to individually enroll in the Service to access it, and will each need a unique password and username.</p>
<p>We may offer Delegate Tools (online or otherwise) that help you manage the authority and access of the Authorized Representatives and Delegates you appoint. Some Delegate features may not be available for certain accounts or customers. Additional features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Owners and certain Authorized Representatives of Eligible Accounts may use the Delegate Tools to name a Delegate;</li>
<li>We may provide Delegate Tools that let one Delegate establish, or manage the access of, another Delegate;</li>
<li>Delegates who are Authorized Representatives may also have authority in addition to that established using the Delegate Tools;</li>
<li>We will treat a Delegate appointment by one owner or certain Authorized Representatives of an Eligible Account as a Delegate appointment by all other owners of that Eligible Account;</li>
<li>View Only – Guest users and authorized users may have access to an Eligible Account or Online Financial Service, but only to view balance and transaction information and other non-transactional capabilities as permitted by the Service. If Delegate Tools are used by you to grant a guest user or authorized user with a username, password or other login credential to access an Online Financial Service, you understand that you are responsible for any actions taken using your, your guest user, or authorized user’s username and password; and</li>
<li>View and Transact – Authorized Representatives may have access to an Eligible Account or Online Financial Service, and may engage in and authorize specified transactions permitted by the Service.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you make someone who is enrolled in the Service an authorized signer on an Eligible Account, we may treat that authorized signer as a Delegate and automatically assign View and Transact authority to that Delegate.</p>
<p>You agree that you may only appoint Delegates in accordance with the requirements we provide to you. This provision takes precedence over any conflicting provision in any other agreement you have with us. We may discontinue offering Delegate options or permitting Delegates to access your Eligible Account or Online Financial Services at any time, without prior notice.</p>
<p>An Authorized Representative or Delegate’s transactions are considered authorized, unless (1) you tell us that they are no longer authorized as an Authorized Representative or Delegate, and (2) we have had reasonable opportunity to act on your notification (unless otherwise provided by law or regulation).</p>
<p>For more details, please see the agreements for your Eligible Accounts and Online Financial Services.</p>
<p>A Delegate’s authority will end when we have a reasonable opportunity to act on any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>An owner of an Eligible Account or Authorized Representative lets us know that the Delegate’s authority has ended and requests that the Delegate be removed.</li>
<li>An owner lets us know that the owner who appointed the Delegate is no longer an owner on the Eligible Account and requests that the Delegate be removed.</li>
<li>If we get written notice of the delegating owner’s death/incapacity from a reliable source such as a court (applies to Consumer and sole-proprietor Business Eligible Accounts only) and requests that the Delegate be removed.</li>
<li>The Delegate is no longer enrolled in the Service as a Delegate.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also call <span class="c12">1-800-956-4442</span> or the phone number located on your statement for assistance in managing your Delegate access. If you made a Delegate appointment through another area, you may need to follow the process for terminating the Delegate appointment through that same area to ensure all required actions are completed.</p>
<h3><a id="service-signature" name="service-signature"><span></span></a> 2(c). Signature Requirement Waiver</h3>
<p>Any requirement to verify two or more signatures on any item (such as a check) does not apply to electronic transfers. This means that you’re allowing any Authorized Representative on your Eligible Account to individually make electronic transfers, even though his/her authority to transfer or withdraw funds from your account by some other means (such as by check) must be exercised jointly with one or more other persons.</p>
<p>This provision controls and takes precedence over any conflicting provision in any other agreements you have with us.</p>
<h3><a id="service-acknowledgements" name="service-acknowledgements"><span></span></a> 2(d). Summary of Acknowledgements</h3>
<p>You agree that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each of your Authorized Representatives and Delegates will be acting as your agent and will be bound by this Agreement and any separate agreement governing the Eligible Account or Online Financial Service.</li>
<li>We may rely and act on the instructions of any Authorized Representative or Delegate.</li>
<li>All transactions that an Authorized Representative or Delegate performs on an Eligible Account or Online Financial Service, including those you did not want or intend, are transactions authorized by you. You are solely responsible for those transactions.</li>
<li>You are solely responsible for supervising all of your Authorized Representatives and Delegates, and monitoring the actions they take on your behalf, whether or not we provide Delegate Tools for managing their authority.</li>
<li>You will be responsible for ensuring each Authorized Representative or Delegate maintains the confidentiality of that person’s username, password or other login identification.</li>
<li>Each Delegate will access and use each Eligible Account and Online Financial Service, in accordance with the authority given to the Delegate by the delegating owner or Authorized Representative.</li>
<li>Each time the Delegate accesses, views or transacts on an Eligible Account or Online Financial Service, you represent and warrant to us that the delegating owner authorizes the Delegate’s action.</li>
<li>If we get conflicting instructions, if we believe that an Eligible Account’s security or our security may be at risk as a result of a Delegate, or if the Delegate violates any part of this Agreement, we may at our sole discretion end the Delegate’s access to:
<ul>
<li>The Service.</li>
<li>An Eligible Account.</li>
<li>An Online Financial Service.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We may also prevent the individual from being a Delegate, or discontinue the individual's Delegate authority, without prior notice to you or any Eligible Account owner.</p></div>

<h3><a name="electronic-applicability" id="electronic-applicability"><span></span></a> 5(a). Applicability</h3>
<p>The provisions in this Section apply only to electronic fund transfers (EFTs) that debit or credit a Consumer's checking, savings, or other asset account and are subject to Regulation E, which implements the federal Electronic Fund Transfer Act. You can find the terms and conditions that apply to EFTs that debit or credit a brokerage account in your brokerage account agreement, not this Agreement.</p>
<p>When applicable, we may rely on any exceptions to the provisions in this Section that are covered in Regulation E. All terms in this Section not defined in this Agreement but defined in Regulation E will have the meaning given in Regulation E.</p>
<h3><a name="electronic-your" id="electronic-your"><span></span></a> 5(b). Your Liability </h3>
<p>Except for EFTs to or from brokerage accounts, your liability for an unauthorized EFT or a series of related unauthorized EFTs will be determined as follows:</p>

<p>If your delay in notifying us was due to extenuating circumstances, we’ll extend the times specified in the immediately preceding paragraphs to a reasonable period.</p>
<p>Note that these liability rules are established by Regulation E, which implements the federal Electronic Fund Transfer Act and do not apply to business accounts. Our account agreements regarding unauthorized debit card, ATM Card, Wells Fargo EasyPay<sup>®</sup>, and consumer and business credit card transactions may give you more protection, provided you report the transactions promptly.

<h3><a name="electronic-errors" id="electronic-errors"><span></span></a> 5(c). Errors/Unauthorized Electronic Fund Transfers/Questions</h3>
<p>Here’s how to notify us when you believe that an error, unauthorized EFT, or unauthorized transfer has been or may have been made:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Phone.</strong> <span class="c12">1-800-956-4442</span>, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.</li>
<li><strong>Paper Mail.</strong> Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., P.O. Box 6995, Portland, OR 97228-6995.</li>
<li><strong>Online.</strong> Sign on to the Service with your username and password and use the appropriate form. For questions or errors about bill payment transactions, use the inquiry forms accessible through Bill Pay.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To notify us of errors in brokerage account transfers, follow the procedures in your brokerage account agreement.</strong></p>
<p>To limit your liability for subsequent unauthorized transfers, or to report any other errors, we must hear from you no later than 60 days after the date we send the first statement on which the problem or error appeared.</p>
<p>When contacting us about an error or with questions, please tell us:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your name and account number (if any).</li>
<li>About the error or the transfer you question, and clearly explain why you believe it is an error or why you need more information.</li>
<li>The dollar amount and date of the suspected error.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you report a problem by phone, we may ask you to submit your complaint or question in writing within 10 Business Days. We’ll determine whether an error occurred within 10 Business Days after we hear from you and will promptly correct any error. If we need more time to conduct our investigation, we’ll notify you of our need for an extension of up to 45 days. If we decide to do this, we’ll provisionally credit your account within 10 Business Days for the amount you think is in error, so you can use the money during the time it takes us to complete our investigation. If we ask you to put your complaint or question in writing and don’t receive it within 10 Business Days, we may not provisionally credit your account.</p>
<p>We may permit you to initiate or monitor the status of certain kinds of complaints or questions electronically on the Website. Complaints or questions you initiate via the process we provide on the Website will be considered as written notification.</p>
<p>For errors involving new accounts, point-of-sale or foreign-initiated transactions, our investigation may take up to 90 calendar days. For new accounts, we may take up to 20 Business Days to credit your account for the amount you think is in error.</p>
<p>We will tell you the results within three Business Days after completing our investigation. If we decide that there was no error, we will send you a written explanation and you can ask for copies of the documents that we used in our investigation.</p>
<h3><a name="electronic-documentation" id="electronic-documentation"><span></span></a> 5(d). Documentation</h3>
<p>You have the right to find out whether an EFT was credited to or debited from your Eligible Account. To do so, contact us at the number listed on your statement for your Eligible Account.</p>
<p>We’ll send you a monthly statement if there are EFTs in a particular month. Otherwise, we’ll send you a statement at least quarterly.</p>
<p>You can get a receipt at the time you make any EFT to or from your account using one of our ATMs or when you use your card at a merchant terminal.</p>
<h3><a name="electronic-handling" id="electronic-handling">⁠</a>5(e). Handling Preauthorized Payments (Recurring)</h3>
<p><strong>Right to stop payment:</strong> If you have told us in advance to make regular (recurring) payments out of your account, you can stop any of these payments. Here’s how: Call Wells Fargo Phone Bank at <span class="c12">1-800-869-3557</span>, or write to us at Wells Fargo, Customer Correspondence, P.O. Box 6995, Portland, OR, 97228-6995, in time for us to receive your request three Business Days or more before the payment is scheduled to be made. If you call, we may also require you to put your request in writing and get it to us within 14 days after you call. Stop payment fees may apply. Please refer to the account agreement governing your Eligible Account(s) for more information.</p>
<p><strong>Notice of varying amounts:</strong> If the amount of these regular (recurring) payments vary, the party you are going to pay should tell you 10 days before each payment, when it will be made and how much it will be. (The party you are going to pay may allow you to choose to get this notice only when the payment would differ by more than a certain amount from the previous payment, or when the amount would fall outside certain limits that you set.)</p>
<p><strong>Liability for failure to stop payment:</strong> If you order us to stop one of these payments three Business Days or more before the transfer is scheduled, and we do not do so, we will pay for your losses or damages.</p>
<h3><a name="electronic-liability" id="electronic-liability">⁠</a>5(f). Our liability for failure to make transfers</h3>
<p>If we do not complete a transfer to or from your account on time or in the correct amount according to our agreement with you, we will be liable for your losses or damages. However, there are some exceptions. For instance, we will not be liable if:</p>
<ul>
<li>Through no fault of ours, you do not have enough money in your account to make the transfer,</li>
<li>The transfer would go over the credit limit on a credit account linked for overdraft protection,</li>
<li>The Service was not working properly and you knew about the breakdown when you started the transfer,</li>
<li>Circumstances beyond our control (such as fire or flood) prevent the transfer, despite reasonable precautions we have taken, or</li>
<li>There is some other exception stated in any of our agreements with you.</li>

<h3><a name="digital-description" id="digital-description">⁠</a> 6(a). General Description</h3>
<p>Wells Fargo Bill Pay ("Bill Pay”) lets you schedule bill payments through the Service. You must have at least one Eligible Account that is a Wells Fargo checking account, a Wells Fargo Advisors brokerage account with the Brokerage Cash Services feature (“Brokerage Cash Services account”), or a Priority Credit Line accessible through the Service, to use Bill Pay. You authorize us to add Eligible Accounts that are Wells Fargo credit card or loan accounts as payees in Bill Pay, but depending on your history related to those accounts, we may not automatically establish them as your Bill Pay payees. For certain providers, you may have to provide additional identification information to see the bill detail information from our Website, or you may have to visit your provider’s site directly to see bill detail information.</p>
<p>You can arrange, at your option, for the payment of your current, future, and automatic (recurring) bills from the accounts listed below. Please note that these accounts, called “Funding Accounts,” have certain payment limits, also listed below (with the exception of the Bill Pay Real Time Payments Service described in section (l) below).

<p>Bill Pay payments made with an eligible credit account cannot be used to make payments on other Wells Fargo credit products. A Funding Account may not be used to pay any part of the balance you owe on that Funding Account. Eligible Accounts that require two or more signatures or authorizations to withdraw or transfer funds may not be used as a Funding Account. A Funding Account must remain linked to the Service in order to use the Funding Account for current, future and automatic (recurring) Bill Pay payments.</p>
<p>Other than as stated above, there is no limit to the number of payments that may be authorized (except that (i) payments funded with a credit account are limited to the total of the available credit in the account when payments are made, and (ii) the number of transfers from an eligible money market checking account is limited as detailed in the Wells Fargo Deposit Account Agreement).</p>
<p>You may pay any payee approved by us in the continental United States, Alaska and Hawaii, and the following United States Territories: Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. Payments to a person or business with an APO or FPO address will be made via paper check.</p>
<p>Joint account holders may use the same account as their Funding Account for their individual use of Bill Pay.</p>
<p>If you give us the name and address of a payee, or an image of a payee bill or invoice, you authorize us to follow your payment instructions regarding that payee. In some cases, we may submit payments to the best-known payee name or address. Bill Pay payments sent via paper check with varying payee names may be combined in one envelope if those payments have the same mailing address, and the payee has not registered their full/unique mailing address with the USPS, including their secondary address designation, e.g. - Suite, Room, Floor, Dept., Building, or Unit. If we need to, we’ll change or reformat your payee account number to match the account number or format required by your payee for electronic payment processing and eBill activation.</p>
<p>Bill Pay is intended for your use only to pay bills and invoices, and not for any other purpose. Using Bill Pay to process payments on behalf of someone other than an owner is prohibited and will be grounds for termination of Bill Pay and your access to the Service.</p>
<p>We may use non-affiliated third parties acting on our behalf to process Bill Pay payments. These third-party processors must adhere to Wells Fargo’s strict security and privacy-protection standards. Paper checks processed by non-affiliated third parties may show that they were drawn on the third-party processor, rather than on Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.</p>
<p>The date a Bill Pay payment starts processing is referred to in this Agreement as the “Payment Send On Date.” Specific details about the Payment Send On Date will be provided on the Service Web pages when you schedule a Bill Pay payment. We may, at our option, pay or refuse to make bill payments funded by checking accounts, money market accounts, or a Brokerage Cash Services account if it would create an overdraft on those accounts. This decision remains discretionary regardless of whether we’ve previously honored or dishonored overdrafts.</p>
<p>If we receive a bill payment drawn against your checking account, money market, or a Brokerage Cash Services account, and there are insufficient available funds in that account to cover the payment, we may at our sole discretion:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cover the payment by transferring available credit or funds from an account you have linked for Overdraft Protection, or</li>
<li>Pay the bill payment and create an overdraft on your account, or</li>
<li>Decline the bill payment, or</li>
<li>Re-attempt the bill payment the following Business Day (until this second attempt is completed, the payment is pending and cannot be cancelled).</li>
</ul>
<p>Any negative balance on your Funding Account will be governed by your applicable account agreements with us. If a Funding Account is an eligible business credit card or line of credit account, we don't have to make a payment unless that account has sufficient available credit to pay the bill on the Payment Send On Date.</p>
<p>Your account’s terms and conditions describe “over limit fees” that may apply to you if any bill payments, associated fees or finance charges cause your credit account balance to exceed the credit limit. The dollar amount of bill payments through your credit account (whether we make these payments electronically or by check) will be charged to that credit account on the Payment Send On Date.</p>
<p>Finance charges (such as interest and transaction fees) may apply to bill payments funded by a credit account; these charges will be shown to you during the payment scheduling process. Please see your credit account agreement and any written disclosure statements for more information.</p>
<p>If your Funding Account closes or is restricted for any reason, we’ll cancel all pending payments associated with the account. It will be your sole responsibility to make all pending and future payments.</p>
<p>Wells Fargo offers a <a href="../payment-guarantee/index.html" enrollmentid="0000">Bill Pay Payment Guarantee</a> that applies to the use of Bill Pay in certain circumstances.</p>
<h3><a name="digital-same" id="digital-same">⁠</a> 6(b). Wells Fargo Same Day Payments Service<sup>SM</sup></h3>
<p>The Wells Fargo Same Day Payments Service<sup>SM</sup> (“SDP Service”) lets you make one-time same-day bill payments to a participating payee for an additional fee. You must be a subscriber of the service to use it.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can make a same day payment only from an Eligible Wells Fargo checking account, a Brokerage Cash Services account, or Priority Credit Line (the “SDP Service Account”), up to a maximum of $50,000 per payment.</li>
<li>You can’t use accounts that require two or more signatures or authorizations to withdraw or transfer funds with the SDP Service.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a same day payment request submitted before the applicable cutoff time displayed on the Make Payment screens, we’ll debit your SDP Service Account and send funds to the payee that same day (which may be a non-Business Day).</p>
<p>You may make a same day payment to a participating payee by submitting your request before the cut-off time specified on the Make Payment screens. For each same day payment, you get a separate payment confirmation notice that confirms:</p>
<ul>
<li>That your same day payment has been made.</li>
<li>Details of the payment.</li>
<li>A payment reference number.</li>
</ul>
<p>The SDP Service permits duplicate payments on the same day: If you schedule more than one payment to the same payee, for the same amount on the same date, all of the scheduled payments will be sent.</p>
<p>Payments that are in process cannot be canceled or stopped. You can’t cancel a same day payment after you submit it.</p>
<h3><a name="digital-fees" id="digital-fees">⁠</a> 6(c). Fees</h3>
<p>There are no monthly service fees for Bill Pay. However, the SDP Service has <a href="../schedule/index.html" enrollmentid="0000">service fees</a>. Account fees (e.g. monthly service, overdraft) may apply to the Funding Account. For more information on the account fees, please refer to the account agreement you received when you opened your account. See further discussion on other potential fees and charges in Section 6(a) above.</p>
<h3><a name="digital-stop" id="digital-stop">⁠</a> 6(d). Stop/Change Payment</h3>
<p>You have the right to stop or change any scheduled bill payment, if you: (1) do so within the Bill Pay secure online session or by calling Wells Fargo Online Customer Service at <span class="c12">1-800-956-4442</span>, and (2) have submitted your request in time to provide us a reasonable opportunity to act on it before we pay, cash, or otherwise become obligated to pay your bill. See <a href="../payment-guarantee/index.html" enrollmentid="0000">Bill Pay Payment Guarantee</a> for further information.</p>
<p>Stop payment requests aren’t guaranteed: for example, payees can present paper check payments to their bank before the stop payment has been properly processed, and once a paper check has been cashed by the payee or credited to the payee’s account it cannot be stopped. If we successfully stop the payment of a paper check, it may take up to seven Business Days for the funds to be credited back to your account.</p>
<h3><a name="digital-scheduling" id="digital-scheduling">⁠</a> 6(e). Scheduling Payments</h3>
<p>When making payments through Bill Pay, please allow enough time for your payee to receive your payment and credit your account properly. To avoid incurring a finance or other charge imposed by your payee, you must schedule a payment sufficiently in advance of the payment due date, so that the delivery date is before the payment due date.</p>
<p>Bill Pay payments sent by check will show the payer of the check as the “Name on Bill” you have provided for that payee record.</p>
<p>Payments must be scheduled before 7 pm Pacific Time to be processed on that day. We will withdraw funds from your Funding Account on the Business Day following your Payment Send On Date. Your Available Balance may be reduced by the amount of your payment on the calendar day following your Payment Send On Date, if that day is not a Business Day. Payments scheduled from brokerage accounts, if permitted, or a Brokerage Cash Services account may have different cut-off times.</p>
<p>If a paper check is sent and the check is not presented for payment within 90 days, we’ll stop payment on the check and credit the check amount back to your Funding Account.</p>
<p>To avoid sending duplicate Bill Pay payments, if you schedule more than one payment to the same payee for the same amount on the same date, only one payment will be sent.</p>
<h3><a name="digital-errors" id="digital-errors">⁠</a> 6(f). Errors and Liability</h3>
<p>In addition to the provisions in Section 5 above, please refer to our <a href="../payment-guarantee/index.html" enrollmentid="0000">Bill Pay Payment Guarantee</a>, which provides additional benefits in certain circumstances.</p>
<h3><a name="digital-termination" id="digital-termination">⁠</a> 6(g). Termination </h3>
<p>Wells Fargo may terminate your access to Bill Pay without prior notice:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you use or we suspect you have used Bill Pay for other, illegal, fraudulent or unauthorized purposes.</li>
<li>If you establish more than 999 payees.</li>
<li>If you close your checking account, Brokerage Cash Services account or Priority Credit Line and don’t timely designate a new checking account, a Brokerage Cash Services account or Priority Credit Line as a Funding Account.</li>
<li>For Eligible Accounts that are in default or subject to an automatic stay in bankruptcy.</li>
<li>Upon the death of an owner.</li>
</ul>
<p>If Wells Fargo terminates your use of Bill Pay, your online bill payment information will be lost and all pending payments will be cancelled and are your sole responsibility.</p>
<h3><a name="digital-conflicts" id="digital-conflicts">⁠</a> 6(h). Conflicts Between Sections </h3>
<p>If Section 6 conflicts with any other provisions of this Agreement, Section 6 governs with respect to Bill Pay.</p>
<h3><a name="digital-provisions" id="digital-provisions">⁠</a> 6(i). Additional Provisions (Business Accounts Only) </h3>
<p>The provisions in this Section apply only to bill payments from Business accounts. For payment requests from Business accounts, which are subject to Article 4A of the Uniform Commercial Code (“UCC 4A”), we’re liable only for damages required to be paid under UCC 4A. We’ll never be liable for any exemplary, special, indirect, or consequential loss, damage, costs or expense of any nature, including lost profits, except as may be required by law or regulation. You agree that the security procedures required by us under this Agreement set forth security procedures for electronic funds transfer that are commercially reasonable.</p>
<h3><a name="digital-ebills" id="digital-ebills">⁠</a> 6(j). Wells Fargo eBills</h3>
<p>Wells Fargo eBills are the delivery of electronic payment statements for certain types of Wells Fargo loans and line of credit products through Bill Pay. Wells Fargo credit products eligible for Wells Fargo eBills are identified in the Bill Pay portion of the Website, “Eligible Credit Accounts.” We may add or remove categories of credit products from the list of Eligible Credit Accounts at any time. You must enroll each Eligible Credit Account individually in Wells Fargo eBills.</p>
<p>You understand and agree that Wells Fargo eBills are provided for your convenience, and payments due continue to be your responsibility as stated in your promissory note, line of credit agreement, mortgage, deed of trust, credit card agreement or security agreement for each Eligible Loan Account, as applicable.</p>
<p>Any individual borrower on your loan, line of credit, or account can enroll in Wells Fargo eBills. Regardless of the individual who enrolls in Wells Fargo eBills, the terms of this Agreement apply to all borrowers, individually and jointly.</p>
<h3><a name="digital-third" id="digital-third">⁠</a> 6(k). Third-Party eBills</h3>
<p>Third-party eBills are electronic versions of paper bills made available from participating companies that may not contain the full statement details in them. eBills are updated automatically once the eBill is received from participating companies. If the company you are setting up for bill payment offers eBills, we will let you know that the eBill service is available and guide you through the enrollment process.</p>
<p>Companies may require you to provide certain information in order to verify your identity and validate your eligibility to receive an eBill. Wells Fargo does not control what criteria or information a company uses for their eBill setup. Please refer to the company’s privacy notices or contact the company directly if you have concerns over the company’s collection, use, and storage of your data. Once an eBill request is submitted, it may take up to ten (10) Business Days for a company to approve your eBill request. We will send you an email alert regarding the status of your eBill activation.</p>
<p>Since eBills are controlled by third-party companies, Wells Fargo takes no responsibility for any late charges or other adverse consequences if a company delays delivery or fails to deliver a complete or accurate eBill. If you do not receive an eBill or have questions about an eBill, please contact the company directly.</p>
<h3>⁠<a name="digital-bill" id="digital-bill">⁠</a>6(l). Bill Pay Real Time Payments (RTP<sup>®</sup>) Service (Only With Participating Billers/Payees)</h3>
<p>The provisions in this Section only apply to the Bill Pay Real Time Payments (RTP<sup>®</sup>) service (the RTP<sup>®</sup> Service). <strong>If available for your participating biller/payee (payee)</strong>, the RTP Service lets you send a payment from your Eligible Account that is an eligible Wells Fargo checking account to a participating payee in response to the payee’s Request for Payment (RFP). We reserve the right to add additional accounts that are eligible for the RTP Service, in the future. The following provisions supplement your applicable Eligible Account agreement. If there is any conflict between these provisions and your Eligible Account agreement, these provisions will control with respect to the RTP Service.</p>
<p>You can access the RTP Service in Wells Fargo Bill Pay, only in the Wells Fargo Mobile app. When you send a payment using the RTP Service, you authorize us to deduct the amount of the payment from your account immediately, and the funds will typically be made available to the payee within seconds, 24 hours a day, including weekends and holidays. <strong>After it is sent, a Real Time Payment cannot be canceled or amended</strong>. You can request that a payee return funds to you, but the payee is not required to return the funds, even if you entered an incorrect amount, sent a payment to the wrong payee, or did not receive goods or services from the payee as expected. You are responsible for the accuracy of all information you enter to send a payment. If you want to request that a payee return funds that you sent through the RTP Service, please notify us by calling Wells Fargo Online Customer Service at <span class="c12">1-800-956-4442</span>. Our sole obligation is to transmit the request to the payee’s financial institution through the RTP Service. Any dispute between you and a payee must be resolved directly between you and the payee.</p>
<p>For details on the applicable limits for the RTP Service, log in to Bill Pay in Wells Fargo Mobile Banking. We may establish a lower single payment limit for you. We may also establish limits for total daily, weekly, or monthly payments, and we may adjust these limits in our sole discretion.</p>
<p>A payment may fail or be delayed if:</p>
<ul>
<li>there are insufficient funds available in your account to send the payment</li>
<li>the payment does not comply with these provisions or the rules of the RTP Service</li>
<li>the payment exceeds the transaction limits</li>
<li>there is suspected fraud, or in order to comply with regulatory requirements</li>
<li>the payee rejects it</li>
<li>the RTP Service is unavailable for any reason.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a payment is delayed or we do not send it, we will notify you.</p>
<p>If you believe that an erroneous or unauthorized payment has been made through the RTP Service using your account, or that your account credentials have been lost, stolen, or otherwise compromised, please contact us immediately in accordance with Section 5.</p>
<p>We may suspend or terminate your access to Bill Pay at any time, including if we determine that you have used the RTP Service in a manner that violates these provisions. We may also discontinue or modify the RTP Service at any time.</p>
<p>RTP payments will be governed by the laws of the state of New York, including New York’s version of Article 4A of the Uniform Commercial Code, as applicable, without regard to its conflict of laws principles.</p></div>

<h3><a name="bank-description" id="bank-description">⁠</a> 7(a). Description</h3>
<p>Bank-to-bank transfers and transfers between your Wells Fargo accounts (“Transfer Service”) lets you transfer funds:</p>
<ul>
<li>Between your Wells Fargo accounts;</li>
<li>From your Wells Fargo checking and/or savings accounts to your accounts at other United States financial institutions ("Financial Institutions");</li>
<li>From your accounts at other Financial Institutions to your Wells Fargo checking and/or savings accounts and to make payments to your Wells Fargo credit accounts (such as your eligible home equity lines of credit and loan accounts, credit card accounts, and auto loan and mortgage loan accounts);</li>
<li>From your brokerage accounts with Wells Fargo affiliates (excludes self-directed brokerage arrangements that are part of a retirement plan) to your checking and/or savings accounts at other Financial Institutions; and</li>
<li>From your checking and/or savings accounts at other Financial Institutions to your brokerage accounts with Wells Fargo affiliates.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this Section, “Account(s)” refers to each of the accounts referenced above.</p>
<p>For brokerage clients, Wells Fargo provides the online transfer access on the Website and the brokerage affiliate transfers the money according to requests made on the Website.</p>
<p>If your Wells Fargo Accounts and/or Service are terminated for any reason, you will have no further right or access to use the Transfer Service.</p>
<h3><a name="bank-information" id="bank-information">⁠</a> 7(b). Information Authorization for non-Wells Fargo Accounts</h3>
<p>We may verify the non-Wells Fargo Accounts that you add to the Transfer Service. You authorize us to validate the non-Wells Fargo Accounts in a manner selected by us, including through the use of a test transfer, in which one or more low value payments is credited to and debited from your non-Wells Fargo Account. Once the test transfer is complete we may ask you to access this non-Wells Fargo Account to tell us the amount of the test credit or debit or any additional information reported by your Financial Institution with this test transfer. We may also verify non-Wells Fargo Accounts by requiring you to submit proof of ownership of such Account(s).</p>
<h3><a name="bank-accounts" id="bank-accounts">⁠</a> 7(c). Accounts</h3>
<p>By using the Transfer Service, you represent and warrant to us that:</p>
<ul>
<li>You own or are an Authorized Signer on the Account held with us and at the non-Wells Fargo Financial Institution;</li>
<li>Your Account at the non-Wells Fargo Financial Institution is a United States account;</li>
<li>Your Account and applicable law permit transfers;</li>
<li>When transferring funds to and from a Wells Fargo affiliate brokerage Account, the non-Wells Fargo Account is a checking or savings account and is not a brokerage or other type of financial account;</li>
<li>You have the right to authorize and permit us to access your Accounts to complete such fund transfers or for any other purpose authorized by this Section;</li>
<li>By disclosing to us and authorizing us to use Account information and complete the transfer you are not violating any third party rights; and</li>
<li>Information you provide to us is true, current, accurate, and complete.</li>
</ul>
<p>You authorize and permit us to use information you submit to make transfers and to configure the Transfer Service to be compatible with the Accounts.</p>
<p>At all times your relationship with each non-Wells Fargo Financial Institution is independent of Wells Fargo and your use of the Transfer Service. We will not be responsible for any acts or omissions by the non-Wells Fargo Financial Institution, including any modification, interruption or discontinuance of any Account by such Financial Institution or by any other third party, or any fees (including overdraft) that the non-Wells Fargo Financial Institution may charge you during the validation process described in Section 7(b) above.</p>
<p>Not all types of accounts are eligible for Transfer Service. We may decline the use of any Account that we believe may present a risk to you and/or us. Be sure to check with your Financial Institution for restrictions regarding transfers among your retirement (401k, IRA, etc.), savings, trusts, loans, custodial, business, corporate, and other account types.</p>
<h3><a name="bank-transfer" id="bank-transfer">⁠</a> 7(d). Transfer Types and Limitations</h3>
<p><strong>Type of Transfers.</strong> We may add new features to the Transfer Service, including a next day service and a higher limit service. You will be approved or declined for any such additional service at our sole discretion and additional terms and conditions may apply. We may at any time decline a fund transfer that we believe may violate applicable law or regulation.</p>
<p><strong>Frequency of Transfers.</strong> We do not limit the number of fund transfers you may make; however, the account agreement for the relevant Account may provide transfer limits. For security and risk management reasons we may modify the limit, the frequency and the dollar amount of transfers you can make using our Transfer Service. The limits on the frequency and dollar amount of transfers are solely for the protection of Wells Fargo.</p>
<p><strong>Dollar Amount of Transfers.</strong> You may not make fund transfers in excess of dollar limits for the Transfer Service. We reserve the right to change the dollar amount of fund transfers you are permitted to make using our Transfer Service. In the event that your use of the Transfer Service has been suspended and reinstated as provided below (see Section 7(g) Suspension, Reinstatement, and Termination), you understand and agree that your use of the Transfer Service thereafter may be subject to lower dollar amount limitations than would otherwise be permitted by us.</p>
<p><strong>Transfers subject to the Rules of the Accounts.</strong> All fund transfers are subject to the rules, laws, and regulations governing the relevant Accounts. You may not initiate any fund transfers from or to an Account that are not allowed under the rules, laws, or regulations applicable to such Account including rules, laws, or regulations designed to prevent the transfer of fund in violation of the Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) regulations.</p>
<p><strong>Failure or Rejection of Transfers.</strong> Upon learning that the fund transfer could not be completed, we may, but are not required to, make a reasonable effort to complete the transfer again. If the fund transfer fails, we will notify you to contact your non-Wells Fargo Financial Institution to learn more about the failure.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to decline: (i) any fund transfer, (ii) to submit fund transfer instructions or orders, or (iii) to carry out change or cancellation requests.</p>
<p>You represent and warrant to us that you have enough money in the non-Wells Fargo Accounts to make any funds transfer you request that we make on your behalf through the Transfer Service. If we receive a transfer request against your Account and there are not enough available funds in your Account to cover the transfer, we may at our sole discretion:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cover the transfer in accordance with the terms of any written overdraft protection plan that you and we have established; </li>
<li>Cover the transfer and create an overdraft to your Account; or</li>
<li>Decline the transfer.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may make this decision regardless of whether we may have previously honored or dishonored overdrafts. Fees may vary depending on the action we take. Any negative balance on an Account with Wells Fargo is immediately due and payable, unless we agree otherwise in writing, and you agree to reimburse us for the costs and expenses (including attorney fees and expenses) we incur in recovering the negative balance (including overdraft and associated fees).</p>
<p><strong>Your Right to Cancel a Transfer.</strong> Payments that are in process cannot be cancelled or stopped. When the Transfer Service offers recurring and/or future one-time transfers, you may cancel any transfer as long as we receive the request before the process date of the one-time transfer or the next scheduled recurring transfer. For recurring transfers, you may cancel only the next scheduled transfer or the entire recurring transfer schedule. After the entire recurring transfer schedule is cancelled, all future transfers will be cancelled and you must reschedule it if you want transfers to be made in the future. </p>
<p>You may cancel a transfer by logging on to the Transfer Service or by contacting us at Wells Fargo Online Customer Service at <span class="c12">1-800-956-4442</span>.</p>
<h3><a name="bank-authorization" id="bank-authorization">⁠</a> 7(e). Authorization</h3>
<p>You agree that your transfer instructions are the authorization for us to complete the fund transfer. You authorize us to select any means to execute your fund transfer instructions, such as the Automated Clearing House (ACH), wire transfer, or check. You will be bound by the rules, laws, and regulations that govern the applicable fund transfer systems, such as CHIPS, ACH rules as published by the National Automated Clearinghouse Association (Nacha), or Article 4A of the Uniform Commercial Code.</p>
<p>We will make all reasonable efforts to process your transfer requests in a timely manner; however, we reserve the right to hold funds pending settlement or for such period of time as we deem necessary, in our sole discretion, to cover items which may be returned unpaid. For Wells Fargo Accounts, any interest earned on such funds during the hold period will remain the property of Wells Fargo. For brokerage Accounts at a Wells Fargo affiliated broker-dealer, any interest will remain in the brokerage Account.</p>
<p>To complete your fund transfer we may utilize ACH transfers, which will result in a debit to one of your Accounts and a credit to another of your Accounts. All Wells Fargo ACH transfers go through a Wells Fargo transfer account. For ACH debit entries (which debit your other Account and credit your Wells Fargo Account), Wells Fargo Bank typically holds funds for 3-4 Business Days to make sure that the item will not be returned unpaid before we will credit your Account. The hold times may vary for brokerage accounts at a Wells Fargo affiliated broker-dealer. If the ACH transaction is returned for any reason and the payment has been credited to your Account, you authorize us to debit your Account, in whole or in part, for the amount of the returned item and for any returned item fee.</p>
<h3><a name="bank-service" id="bank-service">⁠</a> 7(f). Transfer Service Changes</h3>
<p>Depending on the type of transfer or the type of Wells Fargo Account we may charge fees for the use of the Transfer Service, and for any additional services or features that we may introduce. We will notify you of such charge in advance of the transaction. If you choose to proceed with the transaction, you authorize us to debit your Account in the amount indicated. You agree to pay all fees associated with the use of the Transfer Service. See online <a href="../schedule/index.html" enrollmentid="0000">Fee Information</a> for more information about potential fees.</p>
<h3><a name="bank-suspension" id="bank-suspension">⁠</a> 7(g). Suspension, Reinstatement, and Termination</h3>
<p>Without limiting any other right or remedy that we may have under this Agreement or otherwise, we reserve the right to suspend your right to use the Transfer Service, immediately and without prior notice to you, if we incur a problem with your use of the Transfer Service. We may do so if, for example, there is a failure in attempting to debit any of your Accounts or to collect any of your fund transfers as described above. You understand and agree that such action is reasonable for us to take in order to protect Wells Fargo from loss. In the event of such suspension, you may request reinstatement of your service by contacting us at <span class="c12">1-800-956-4442</span>.</p>
<p>In our sole discretion, we may grant or deny reinstatement of your use of the Transfer Service. If we agree to reinstate you, we may initially reinstate your Transfer Service subject to lower per-transaction and monthly dollar limits and/or with other restrictions. Based upon your subsequent usage of the Transfer Service, we may restore your ability to complete transfers subject to such higher limits as may then be in effect.</p>
<p>Subject to applicable law or regulation, we may terminate your right to use the Transfer Service at any time and for any reason, including if in our sole judgment we believe you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Engaged in conduct or activities that violate any of the terms of this Agreement or our rights; or</li>
<li>Provided us with false or misleading information; or</li>
<li>Interfered with other users or the administration of the Transfer Services.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="bank-number" id="bank-number">⁠</a> 7(h). Account Number Policy</h3>
<p>If the instructions for a transfer under the Transfer Service identify a bank or beneficiary by name and account number, we or the relevant Financial Institution may execute those instructions by reference to the account number only, even if the account number does not correspond to the name. You agree that neither we nor the relevant Financial Institution will have responsibility to investigate discrepancies between names and account numbers.</p>
<h3><a name="bank-responsibility" id="bank-responsibility">⁠</a> 7(i). Your Responsibility for Errors</h3>
<p>We must rely on the information you provided, and you authorize us to act on any instruction, which has been or reasonably appears to have been sent by you or your Authorized Representative, to submit fund transfer instructions on your behalf. Financial Institutions receiving the fund transfer instructions may rely on such information. We are not obligated to take any further steps to confirm or authenticate such instructions and will act on them without getting further confirmation. If you or your Authorized Representative provide us with incorrect information or if there is any error in your instruction we will make all reasonable efforts to reverse or delete such instructions, but you accept full responsibility for losses resulting from any of your errors, duplication, ambiguities, or fraud in the information that you provide. If any information you provide is untrue, inaccurate, not current, or incomplete, without limiting other remedies, we may recover from you any costs or losses incurred as a direct or indirect result of the inaccurate or incomplete information.</p>
<p>We are not responsible for errors, delays and other problems caused by or resulting from the action or inaction of Financial Institutions holding the non-Wells Fargo Account, unless otherwise required by law or regulation. Although we will try to assist you in resolving any such problems, you understand that any such errors, delays, or other problems are the responsibility of the relevant Financial Institution. Any rights you may have against a Financial Institution for such errors, delays, or other problems are subject to the terms of the agreements you have with such Financial Institution, including any time limits during which complaints must be made.</p>
<p>Please see EFT Provisions (Consumers) in Section 5 in this Agreement for terms and conditions that apply to electronic fund transfers that debit or credit a consumer checking, savings, or other asset account and are subject to Regulation E.</p>
<h3><a name="bank-liability" id="bank-liability">⁠</a> 7(j). Our Liability</h3>
<p>If we do not provide a fund transfer instruction on time, if we cause an incorrect amount to be removed from an Account or if we cause funds from an Account to be transferred to any account other than the Account specified in the applicable fund transfer instruction, we shall be responsible for returning the improperly transferred funds and/or for directing any misdirected funds to the proper Account.</p>
<p>We are not liable for any costs, fees, losses or indirect, special, or consequential damages of any kind incurred as a result of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our debit and/or credit or inability to debit and/or credit the accounts in accordance with your fund transfer instructions; or</li>
<li>Inaccuracy, incompleteness, or misinformation contained in the information retrieved on the accounts; or</li>
<li>Charges imposed by any non-Wells Fargo Financial Institution or by applicable law or regulation; or</li>
<li>Fund transfer limitations set by the non-Wells Fargo Financial Institutions or applicable law or regulation; or</li>
<li>Not enough money in your Account to make the fund transfer; or</li>
<li>Transfers exceeding the credit limit on any applicable overdraft line; or</li>
<li>System failures at a non-Wells Fargo Financial Institution and we are unable to complete the transfer; or</li>
<li>Third party causes, including your non–Wells Fargo Financial Institution.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="bank-security" id="bank-security">⁠</a> 7(k). Security</h3>
<p><strong>Security Procedures.</strong> The Financial Institution at which your account is maintained may contact us to verify the content and authority of fund transfer instructions and any changes to those instructions. In connection with the Transfer Service, we may provide to that Financial Institution such information as may be required to verify the instructions and the verification may constitute a valid security procedure under the rules governing that Account.</p>
<p><strong>Deviating from Security Procedures.</strong> You permit us to authorize your non-Wells Fargo Financial Institution to accept funds and transfer instructions in accordance with any authorization procedures you and such Financial Institution have agreed upon, or that we, on your behalf, and such Financial Institution have agreed upon, without verifying the instructions under the established security procedures, regardless of whether you agreed to the security procedures or we agreed on your behalf. In addition, we may authorize such Financial Institutions to charge and debit your Accounts based solely on these communications.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Provisions for Business Accounts.</strong> The provisions in this Section apply only to transfers to and/or from business accounts. You agree that the password security described in the Agreement and in this Section sets forth security procedures for fund transfers that are commercially reasonable. For transfer requests to and/or from business accounts, which are subject to Article 4A of the Uniform Commercial Code (“UCC 4A”), you agree that we are liable only for damages required to be paid under UCC 4A. In no event will we be liable for any special, indirect or consequential loss, damage, costs or expense of any nature, including lost profits, even if we have been informed of the possibility of such damages, except as may be required by law or regulation.</p></div>

<h3><a name="mobile-deposit-description" id="mobile-deposit-description"><span></span></a> 8(a). Description</h3>
<p>The Wells Fargo Mobile Deposit Service (“Mobile Deposit Service”) allows you to make a deposit directly into your eligible checking or savings account using the Wells Fargo Mobile app. Mobile Deposit Service allows you to submit photos of the front and back of your endorsed, eligible check, which you authorize us to then process.</p>
<p>Download the Wells Fargo Mobile app on an eligible mobile device. Please refer to <a href="../../help/online-banking/browser-supported/index.html" enrollmentid="0000">Supported Browsers</a> for operating system requirements.</p>
<p>Availability of the Mobile Deposit Service may be affected by your mobile carrier’s coverage area.</p>
<p>Some accounts are not eligible for mobile deposit.</p>
<p>We set limits on the amount you can deposit via our Mobile Deposit Service, which will be shown for each Eligible Account. Mobile deposit limits may differ for each Eligible Account. You must comply with any restrictions or dollar limits on the Mobile Deposit Service as we may communicate to you from time to time.</p>
<h3><a name="mobile-deposit-fees" id="mobile-deposit-fees"><span></span></a> 8(b). Fees</h3>
<p>There currently are no fees to use the Mobile Deposit Service. We reserve the right to charge a fee for use of the Mobile Deposit Service. We will inform you of any future fees to use the Mobile Deposit Service when legally required to do so, and we’ll try to notify you of material changes as soon as possible even when we are not legally required to do so.</p>
<p>Note that your mobile carrier’s message and data rates may apply.</p>
<h3><a name="mobile-deposit-checks" id="mobile-deposit-checks">⁠</a>8(c). Types of Checks Eligible for the Mobile Deposit Service, and Other Requirements</h3>
<p>You can deposit checks payable in U.S. dollars and drawn at any U.S. bank, including personal, business, and most government checks. Only checks, money orders, cashier’s checks, or American Express traveler’s checks, drawn on or payable at or through a U.S. bank, can be transmitted through the Mobile Deposit Service.</p>
<p>Checks must be payable to, and endorsed by, the account owner for the Eligible Account, as follows: before check photos are taken, the back of the check must be signed with “For Mobile Deposit at Wells Fargo Bank Only” written below your signature (or if available, check the box that reads: “Check here if mobile deposit”).</p>
<p>Checks and other items that are NOT eligible for the Mobile Deposit Service include: international checks, U.S. savings bonds, U.S. postal money orders, remotely created checks (whether in paper form or electronically created), electronically created items (items created electronically and not derived from a paper check), convenience checks (checks drawn against a line of credit), non-American Express traveler's checks, cash, checks that are illegible or contain MICR data that is not machine-readable, and duplicate checks.</p>
<p>After depositing your check using mobile deposit, you must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write “mobile deposit" and the date on the front of your check. The date should be the month, day, and year of your deposit; and</li>
<li>Securely store your check for 5 days after your deposit, and then destroy it. This allows sufficient time in case the original check is required for any reason.</li>
</ul>
<p>You are prohibited from duplicate scanning, negotiating, and/or depositing the same original paper checks.</p>
<p>You must also ensure that the checks have not been altered, and that the photos sent via the Mobile Deposit Service are an accurate depiction of the front and back of the original check to be deposited.</p>
<p>You are responsible for any numerical errors on deposit data entry.</p>
<h3><a name="mobile-deposit-funds" id="mobile-deposit-funds">⁠</a>8(d). Mobile Deposit Funds Availability</h3>
<p>Subject to the conditions for eligibility, checks are deemed accepted for deposit on the Business Day that we process the check, as long as the check is deposited prior to the cut-off time. Please see the <a href="../../help/mobile-features/mobile-deposit-faqs/index.html" enrollmentid="0000">Mobile Deposit FAQs</a> for further information.</p>
<p>Some checks can take longer to process, so we may need to hold some or all of the deposit for a little longer. If a hold is applied at the time of deposit to any portion of your deposit, you’ll receive notification from us, including when funds will be available, prior to submitting your deposit and you can cancel your deposit at that time. Note that there could be other holds on funds after a deposit. In such case, you will receive notification from us. Please see your deposit account agreement for further information.</p>
<p>You’ll know that your deposit is available when the amount appears online in the available balance of the Eligible Account you selected when you submitted your mobile deposit. This balance may not reflect all of your transactions, such as checks you have written or debit card transactions that have been approved but not yet submitted for payment by the merchant.</p>
<h3><a name="mobile-deposit-termination" id="mobile-deposit-termination"><span></span></a> 8(e). Termination</h3>
<p>We may terminate the Mobile Deposit Service at any time. You may stop using the Mobile Deposit Service at any time. However, any image transmitted through the Mobile Deposit Service shall be subject to this Agreement.</p>
<h3><a name="mobile-deposit-audit" id="mobile-deposit-audit"><span></span></a> 8(f). Right to Audit</h3>
<p>We may periodically audit and verify your compliance with this Section or for any other reason in connection with the Mobile Deposit Service. You agree to cooperate and provide information or documents at your expense as may be reasonably requested by us in the course of such audit.</p></div>

<h3><a name="online-description" id="online-description"><span></span></a> 11(a). Description</h3>
<p>Many account documents - including statements, tax documents, and legal notices - can be delivered online for certain Eligible Accounts and Online Financial Services. You have the option to view, save, or print PDF versions of your account documents from the Website via desktop, tablet, or mobile device.</p>
<p>Any legal notices or disclosures about your Eligible Account or Online Financial Service that would normally accompany your paper account statement, or that we would mail to you, may be delivered to you electronically. In some cases, we must continue to mail paper statements, legal notices, and disclosures even if you elect to receive them electronically. Wells Fargo is not responsible for statement non-delivery if you do not maintain a valid email address as described in Section 11(c).</p>
<p>We’ll email you to notify you that a statement is available and you can view, print, and/or save at your convenience. By requesting that bills, statements, or other communications from us be sent to you electronically, you warrant that you have the right, power, and authority to receive them electronically.</p>
<p>We may offer you additional options/preferences for delivery of various communications related to your Eligible Accounts or Online Financial Services. The following is a brief description of the various features of and requirements for using online statements and documents. We may add to, modify, or delete any feature of online statements and documents at our sole discretion.</p>
<h3><a name="online-eligible" id="online-eligible"><span></span></a> 11(b). Eligible Accounts</h3>
<p>Most Eligible Account statements and documents can be delivered online. You can determine online statement eligibility by signing on to the <a href="https://connect.secure.wellsfargo.com/auth/login/present?origin=cob&amp;LOB=CONS" enrollmentid="2429">Website</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="online-enrollment" id="online-enrollment"><span></span></a> 11(c). Enrollment</h3>
<p>Online statements and documents are available for certain Eligible Accounts or Online Financial Services if you have completed enrollment in the Service and provided us with a valid email address. Once enrolled, we will send you an email notice (as described in Section 9(a)) notifying you when your statement or document is available on the Website. To ensure that you continue to receive such email notifications, you must notify us of any changes or updates to your email address. We may revoke your online-only statement and document option and change your delivery preference to U.S. Mail if you don’t maintain a valid email address.</p>
<p>Delivery preferences can be changed by any account owner or Authorized Representative, and the new delivery preference will apply to all owners or Authorized Representatives of that account.</p>
<p>Depending on the Eligible Account or Online Financial Service, one or more of the following may be true:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many Eligible Accounts and Online Financial Services automatically come with online-only delivery for statements and documents. This means you will no longer receive paper statements and documents, unless required by law or regulation. You can change your delivery preference back to U.S. Mail at any time.</li>
<li>For Eligible Accounts or Online Financial Services that don’t automatically come with online-only delivery, you can choose online-only delivery for that Eligible Account or Online Financial Service.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="online-check" id="online-check"><span></span></a> 11(d). Check Images</h3>
<p>For deposit accounts, you may view online images of the individual checks posted to your account. If you currently receive an account statement with check images in paper format, once you choose online-only statements and documents, you will no longer receive the check images as part of the statement. You can ask us to mail a photocopy of a cancelled check to you (additional fees may apply).</p>
<h3><a name="online-access" id="online-access"><span></span></a> 11(e). Access</h3>
<p>You can access your online statements and documents (including legal notices and disclosures) on the Website.</p>
<p>Statements are available online for up to a maximum of seven years, depending on the type of account enrolled. Statements for some types of Eligible Accounts or Online Financial Services are available for shorter time frames. If you didn’t choose online-only delivery when the account was first opened, there may be a gap in the historical statements available online for some types of Eligible Accounts or Online Financial Services.</p>
<p>For some types of Eligible Accounts or Online Financial Services, there may be a delay of up to several weeks after enrollment before you can start viewing statements and documents online. You can still request historical account statements (fees may apply); please refer to the applicable account agreement and disclosures for details.</p>
<p>If you close your account, your online statements and documents for that account will be available for viewing, downloading, or saving for approximately 90 days after the date of closure. You can still request historical account statements (fees may apply); please refer to the applicable account agreement and disclosures for details.
<br /></p>
<h3><a name="online-portfolio" id="online-portfolio"><span></span></a> 11(f). Portfolio by Wells Fargo<sup>®</sup></h3>
<p>For Portfolio by Wells Fargo customers, only the owners or Authorized Representative(s) of the primary checking account in the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program (Program Owners) will have access to the entire online combined statement.</p>
<p>Other account(s) may be linked to the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program in either a Detail Level Format or Summary Level Format, as available:</p>
<ul>
<li>If Detail Level Format – all information regarding the linked account will be included in the combined Portfolio by Wells Fargo statement in detail. A standalone online-only account statement will be created for the linked account.  </li>

<li>The owners of the Portfolio by Wells Fargo primary checking account, as well as any additional owners of linked accounts are responsible for verifying the accuracy of the account information.
<br /></li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="online-year" id="online-year"><span></span></a> 11(g). Year-end Tax Reporting Documents</h3>
<p>Online year-end tax documents may be available to customers with certain account types who are enrolled in the Service and provide a valid email address for the Service. You don’t have to complete a separate enrollment process to view your tax documents online. This option is available regardless of whether we also mail your paper tax documents. </p>
<p>You are entitled to receive paper versions of your tax documents by U.S. Mail. By selecting Online as your Delivery Preference, you are consenting to receive those tax documents electronically instead. Please make note of the following important information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your consent applies to all the tax documents you have designated for Online delivery. The consent for each form designated will remain in effect for every year that form is required to be furnished until the consent is withdrawn in the manner provided below. Tax documents will remain available to you online until at least October 15 of the year in which they are delivered for Eligible Accounts (except for closed accounts, as provided in Sections 3(d) and 11(e) of this Agreement).  </li>
<li>You may withdraw your consent to electronic delivery by changing your delivery preferences back to U.S. Mail from the delivery preference section of the Website, by calling customer service at <span class="c12">1-800-956-4442</span>, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week (Wells Fargo Advisor accounts call <span class="c12">1-877-879-2495</span>), or in writing to Wells Fargo Bank N.A., PO Box 4132, Concord CA 94518-4917.

Depending on timing, delivery preference changes for tax documents may not take effect for the upcoming tax season.  </li>
<li>For Brokerage, certain tax forms, 5498 and Fair Market Value information related to your accounts, may be delivered as part of your monthly account statement. If you agree to Online delivery for monthly account statement documents, you also agree to online delivery for these documents.</li>
<li>You will receive confirmation via email of any change to your Delivery Preference. Should you change your Delivery Preference to U.S. Mail, this email will be the written confirmation of your withdrawal of consent to electronic delivery.</li>
<li>You may obtain a paper copy of any tax document we deliver electronically by calling customer service at <span class="c12">1-800-956-4442</span>, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week; or for Wells Fargo Advisors accounts, please contact your Financial Advisor or call <span class="c12">1-877-879-2495</span>. Requesting a paper copy of your electronically-delivered tax document does not change your Delivery Preference or withdraw your consent to electronic delivery.</li>
<li>Tax documents will no longer be delivered to you electronically if you close the related account or end your online banking relationship with us.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may update your contact information and email address within the “Update Contact Information” section found on the Website.

<li>a computer and an operating system capable of supporting all of the above.</li>

<li>Your inability to use the download, transfer and/or bill pay option;</li>
<li>The accuracy, timeliness, loss or corruption, or misdelivery of any Eligible Account information, transfer, bill payment, or any other information;</li>
<li>Unauthorized access to your Eligible Accounts or to your account information and any misappropriation, or alteration, of your account information or data, to the extent the unauthorized access results from your acts or omissions;</li>
<li>Your inability to access your Eligible Account (including, failure of electronic or mechanical equipment, interconnect problems with telephone providers or Internet service providers ("ISPs"), natural disasters, strikes, or other labor problems); or</li>
<li>Any other matter relating to the download, transfer or bill pay option.</li>
</ul>
<p>You understand and agree that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not all the information in your Eligible Accounts can be downloaded into your Financial Management Software.</li>
<li>Information you can download may not include all of your account activity.</li>
<li>Statements we generate are the official record of account transactions, positions and balances; the information you download is for tracking purposes only and should not be considered an official record.</li>
<li>Account information won’t necessarily reflect banking, financial, or investment activities and transactions that have not yet been completed or settled, and will only reflect the account information in your Eligible Accounts at the exact point in time that you download the information (for example, trades that have not yet been settled may not be reflected).</li>
<li>Account information in your Eligible Accounts may reflect transactions as of a prior time period and may not be current when you download the information.</li>
<li>We won’t automatically update account information that you download to your Financial Management Software. You will have to update the Eligible Account information by downloading more current information from your accounts (for example, stock prices, and/or the value of the investments we hold in your brokerage account, may be reflected at the prices at the close of the prior trading day and not at the current prices).</li>
<li>Eligible Account information may include information you provided to us (for example, cost or tax basis information for securities we have transferred into your brokerage account); you’re solely responsible for the accuracy of this information.</li>
<li>We aren’t liable for any loss, damages, or expenses of any kind as a result of your reliance upon the Eligible Account information in your Financial Management Software (which may not be up to date and may not include pending transactions such as a stock sales or purchases that haven’t settled).</li>
<li>You assume all risk that unauthorized third parties may access any Eligible Account information you download and store in your Financial Management Software.</li>
<li>If you send information in an unsecure manner or take the Eligible Account information out of our secure systems by downloading it, we’re no longer responsible for the security and confidentiality of that information, and the responsibility is now yours (or may be shared with others, such as your Financial Management Software provider).</li>
<li>We aren’t responsible for the security and confidentiality of the Eligible Account information if you:
<ul>
<li>Use wireless connections to download your account information, in which case you acknowledge other persons may be able to access the information being downloaded; or</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Let others access or use your Financial Management Software.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Downloads of Eligible Account information are at your own risk. You are solely responsible for any resulting damage to the computer (or other electronic device) to which you download any information.</li>

<h3><a name="dispute-description" id="dispute-description"><span></span></a> 19(a). Description</h3>
<p>This Section constitutes the arbitration agreement between you and us ("Arbitration Provision"), and includes a mutual waiver of class action rights. It governs disputes about the following, which are known as “Covered Disputes”:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interpretation of this Agreement (which includes this Arbitration Provision and whether a disagreement is a "dispute" subject to binding arbitration as provided for in this Arbitration Provision).</li>
<li>The Service.</li>
<li>The Online Access Process.</li>
<li>Online Financial Services ("Covered Disputes").</li>
</ul>
<p>This Section does not cover the following disputes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disputes about Eligible Accounts that are brokerage accounts. These are governed by the Pre-Dispute Arbitration Agreement and governing law provisions contained in the brokerage account agreement document, which takes precedence over this Section.</li>
<li>Disputes arising under any separate agreement governing your other Eligible Accounts. These are governed by the dispute resolution and governing law provisions of that agreement, which also take precedence over this Section.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="dispute-non" id="dispute-non"><span></span></a> 19(b). Non-judicial Dispute Resolution</h3>
<p>You and we agree that any Covered Disputes between or among you and us, regardless of when it arose, will, upon demand by either you or us, be resolved by the arbitration process described in Section (d) below. <strong>You understand and agree that you and we are each waiving the right to a jury trial or a trial before a judge in a public court.</strong></p>
<p>As an exception to this Arbitration Provision, we both retain the right to pursue disputes in small claims court in the state where you reside if the dispute lies within that court's jurisdiction.</p>
<h3><a name="dispute-definition" id="dispute-definition"><span></span></a> 19(c). Definition of Disputes</h3>
<p>A dispute is any unresolved disagreement between or among you and us. Disputes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Claims based on broken promises or contracts.</li>
<li>Torts (injuries caused by negligent or intentional conduct) or other wrongful actions.</li>
<li>Statutory, common law, and equitable claims.</li>
<li>Any disagreement about the meaning of this Arbitration Provision.</li>
<li>Whether a disagreement is a “dispute” subject to binding arbitration as provided for in this Arbitration Provision.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="dispute-binding" id="dispute-binding"><span></span></a> 19(d). Binding Arbitration and Waiver of Class Action Rights</h3>
<p>Binding arbitration lets an independent third party resolve a Covered Dispute without using the court system, judges or juries. Either you or we may require the submission of a Covered Dispute to binding arbitration at any reasonable time, even if a lawsuit or other proceeding has begun. If either you or we don’t submit to binding arbitration following a lawful demand, the one who fails to so submit bears all costs and expenses (including attorney's fees and expenses) incurred by the other in compelling arbitration.</p>
<p><strong>Neither you nor we will be entitled to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Join, consolidate or combine Covered Disputes by or against others in any arbitration; or</strong></li>
<li><strong>Include in any arbitration any Covered Dispute as a representative or member of a class; or</strong></li>
<li><strong>Act in any arbitration in the interest of the general public or in a private attorney general capacity.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Each arbitration, including the selection of the arbitrator, will be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") or such other administrator as you and we may mutually agree to (the AAA or such other mutually agreeable administrator to be referred to here as the “Arbitration Administrator”), according to the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Consumer Arbitration Rules (“AAA Rules”).</p>
<p>To the extent that there is any variance between the AAA Rules and this Arbitration Provision, this Arbitration Provision will control. Arbitrator(s) must be a member of the state bar where the arbitration is held, with expertise in the substantive laws applicable to the subject matter of the Covered Dispute.</p>
<p>You and we each agree that in this relationship:</p>
<ul>
<li>You and we are participating in transactions involving interstate commerce.</li>
<li>The Arbitrator will decide any dispute regarding the enforceability of this Arbitration Provision.</li>
<li>Each arbitration is governed by the provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act (Title 9 of the United States Code) and, to the extent any provision of that Act is inapplicable, unenforceable or invalid, the laws governing the relationship between you and us about which the Covered Dispute arose.</li>
</ul>
<p>To find out how to initiate arbitration, please call any office of the AAA or visit the AAA Website at www.adr.org. If any of the provisions of this Arbitration Provision dealing with class action, class arbitration, private attorney general action, other representative action, joinder, or consolidation is found to be unlawful or unenforceable, that invalid provision shall not be severable and this entire arbitration agreement shall be unenforceable.</p>

<p>This Arbitration Provision and the exercise of any of the rights you and we have under this Arbitration Provision do not stop either of us from exercising any lawful rights to use other remedies available to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Preserve, foreclose, or obtain possession of real or personal property.</li>
<li>Exercise self-help remedies, including setoff and repossession rights.</li>
<li>Obtain provisional or ancillary remedies such as injunctive relief, attachment, garnishment or court appointment of a receiver by a court having jurisdiction.</li>
<li>Enforce your rights under section 502 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="dispute-miscellaneous" id="dispute-miscellaneous"><span></span></a> 19(f). Miscellaneous</h3>
<p>You and we each agree to take all steps and execute all documents necessary for the implementation of arbitration proceedings. The arbitrator may hear and rule on appropriate dispositive motions as part of the arbitration proceeding, such as motions for judgments on the pleadings, summary judgment, or partial summary judgment.</p>
<p>All parties (the AAA, the arbitrators, you and we) must, to the extent feasible, take any action necessary to ensure that an arbitration proceeding, as described in this Arbitration Provision, is completed within 180 days of filing the Covered Dispute with the AAA. This provision will be liberally construed to ensure the enforcement of this Arbitration Provision.</p>
<p>Arbitration proceedings are conducted in the state where you reside or at a location determined by the AAA. All statutes of limitations that apply to any Covered Dispute apply to any arbitration between you and us.</p>
<p>The provisions of this Arbitration Provision will survive termination, amendment, or expiration of your Account relationship, the governing Agreement or any other relationship between you and us.</p>
<p>This Arbitration Provision constitutes the entire agreement between you and us and supersedes all prior arrangements and other communications about dispute resolution. If more than one arbitration agreement mutually entered into by you and us potentially applies to a Covered Dispute, the one most directly related to the Eligible Account or transaction that is the subject of the dispute will control.</p>
<h3><a name="dispute-fees" id="dispute-fees"><span></span></a> 19(g). Fees and Expenses</h3>
<p>Arbitration fees shall be determined by the rules or procedures of the Arbitration Administrator, unless limited by applicable law. Please check with the Arbitration Administrator to determine the fees that apply to any arbitration you may file. If the law that applies to this Agreement limits the amount of fees and expenses you have to pay, then no allocation of fees and expenses to you shall exceed this limitation. We will pay any costs that are required to be paid by us under the arbitration administrator’s rules and procedures, and subject to applicable law. If the arbitrator rules in your favor on any claim presented, we will reimburse you for arbitration filing fees you have paid up to $700.00. Unless applicable law states otherwise, each party will pay their own attorney, expert, and witness fees. This rule applies no matter which party wins arbitration.</p>
<h3><a name="dispute-small" id="dispute-small"><span></span></a> 19(h). Small Claims Court</h3>
<p>Notwithstanding anything in the Agreement to the contrary, each party retains the right to pursue in Small Claims Court any dispute in which the remedy sought is entirely within that court's jurisdiction.</p>

<h3><a name="notices-description" id="notices-description"><span></span></a> 20(a). Description</h3>
<p>We’ll provide notices and other information regarding your Eligible Account, Online Financial Service, or the Service (collectively "Account-Related Information") electronically, by phone, through the mail (U.S. Postal Service or overnight courier), or by other means, except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement.</p>
<p>We’ll send this information to the electronic address ("E-Address"), phone number, or postal address, of the owner of the applicable Eligible Account or Online Financial Service as reflected in our records, unless you specify a different E-address, phone number, or postal address.</p>
<p>Any notice or Account-Related Information we send you will be effective, and deemed delivered to you, when posted on our Website, sent electronically, mailed, or otherwise made available to you. You assume the risk of loss in the mail or other transit.</p>
<p>If your Eligible Account has multiple owners, we may send Account-Related Information to any one of them. The person receiving the notice is responsible for providing copies of all Account-Related Information to all joint account owners, Delegates, or other persons with access to the applicable Eligible Account or Online Financial Service.</p>
<p>Any notice you send to us won’t be effective until we actually receive it and have a reasonable opportunity to act on it.</p>
<h3><a name="notices-electronic" id="notices-electronic"><span></span></a> 20(b). Electronic Delivery</h3>
<p>Unless applicable law or regulation states otherwise or pursuant to the ESIGN Consent to Use Electronic Records and Signatures, when we need to provide you with information in writing, we can send it electronically, either:</p>
<ul>
<li>To your E-Address (if applicable and you have provided us with a valid email address); or</li>
<li>By posting the information to our Website; or</li>
<li>To your online banking secure mailbox, or other electronic means.</li>
</ul>
<p>E-Addresses include email addresses, other Internet addresses, text messaging numbers or other electronic access addresses provided to us in accordance with this Agreement.</p>
<h3><a name="notices-phone" id="notices-phone"><span></span></a> 20(c). Phone Calls and Text Messages</h3>
<p>When you provide a phone number to us, you agree that you own or are authorized to provide the telephone number to us. You expressly agree that we may use <strong>automatic dialing technology and/or artificial or prerecorded voice messages</strong> to call you or send text messages to you on the number you provided to us, even if the phone number is registered to a cell phone number or Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) service. To help protect your account security, Wells Fargo does not support SMS or MMS functionality for recognized VoIP, prepaid or landline phone numbers. In order to receive text messages from Wells Fargo, such as one-time passcodes or suspicious activity alerts, an eligible phone number and mobile device are required. Your mobile carrier’s message and data rates may apply.</p>
<p>You agree that we may call you and text you to service your accounts, collect any amount you may owe or discuss our relationship, products and services with you, as described in this Section.</p>
<h3><a name="notices-communication" id="notices-communication"><span></span></a> 20(d). Communications Sent At Your Request/On Your Behalf</h3>
<p>You authorize us to send emails and text messages to others on your behalf, if needed to carry out your instructions regarding an Eligible Account or Online Financial Service. You confirm and agree that you have obtained consent from the person who owns or is the current subscriber of the email address or phone number to receive the communication. These communications may identify you by name and may state that we’re sending them on your behalf and according to your instructions.</p>
<h3><a name="notices-returned" id="notices-returned"><span></span></a> 20(e). Returned and Unclaimed Notices to You</h3>
<p>Unless otherwise prohibited by the laws or regulations governing your Eligible Account or Online Financial Service, this section applies if Account-Related Information documents are returned or electronic notifications are returned as undeliverable.</p>
<p>This means we can stop sending Account-Related Information or electronic notifications to you until you provide a valid postal or valid email to us.</p>
<p />
<p>
 </p>
<p>We may also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Destroy Account-Related Information sent to you and returned to us as undeliverable.</li>
<li>Hold the Account-Related Information for your Account for you to pick up.</li>
<li>Stop sending the Account-Related Information through the current delivery method and use an alternative delivery method. For example, if we’re sending Account-Related Information to you via the U.S. Postal Service, and the information is returned to us as undeliverable on two or more occasions, we may attempt to deliver the information to your E-Address instead.</li>
<li>Suspend access to your Eligible Accounts or Online Financial Services.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we hold Account-Related Information for you to pick up and it remains unclaimed for a period of time, we may send the Account-Related Information to the address reflected in our records for your Eligible Account or destroy it.</p>
<h3><a name="notices-contact" id="notices-contact"><span></span></a> 20(f). Contact Information Changes</h3>
<p>You agree to notify us immediately if you no longer own or you are no longer authorized to use or share your address, E-Address or phone number you previously provided to us. Address changes may be initiated:</p>
<ul>
<li>At your request - you can instruct us to change the address or E-Address to which we send notices or Account-Related Information about your Account at any time.</li>
<li>If we get an address change notice from the U.S. Postal Service.</li>
<li>If another party in the business of providing correct address information notifies us that the address in our records no longer corresponds to your address.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may act on instructions purportedly made on your behalf within a reasonable time after we receive them.</p>
<p>Unless you instruct us otherwise, we may change the U.S. Postal Service address or E-Address only for the account(s) you specify, or for all or some of your other account(s) with us.</p>
<p>Please note, to change the address associated with an employer-sponsored retirement or deferred compensation plan, follow the address-change procedures established by your employer or plan administrator.</p>
