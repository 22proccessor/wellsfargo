<br /></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>the terms or instructions appearing on a screen when enrolling for, activating, accessing, or using the Transfer Service;</li>

You agree that you will only use the Transfer Service for Transfer Transactions entered into for lawful purposes, and not for purposes or activities that may lead to liability, reputational harm, or brand damage to Wells Fargo or <em>Zelle</em>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>For example, you agree that you will not use the Transfer Service to request, send, or receive money in connection with: </strong></p>

	<div class="c16content"><p>In order to use the Transfer Service you must have an eligible Funding Account or Deposit Account based in the United States, which includes Wells Fargo Bank checking, savings or prepaid accounts, Wells Fargo Advisors checking accounts, and Wells Fargo The Private Bank checking and savings accounts. The Funding Account and the Deposit Account may be the same account. Account eligibility rules may differ if you are enrolling in <em>Zelle</em> through a separate financial institution or on <em>Zelle’s</em> separate transfer service website or mobile app. In order to receive fund transfers into your Deposit Account, that account must be in good standing. In order to transfer funds out of your Funding Account to another individual or business, you must have an available balance in that account. You represent that you have the authority to authorize debits and credits to the enrolled Funding Account or Deposit Account.</p>
<p>You agree that there may be other eligibility requirements that apply to participate in the Transfer Service (e.g., non-U.S. persons may be prohibited from using the Transfer Service), and that we have the right and sole discretion, to restrict or otherwise prohibit your use of the Transfer Service.</p>

</ul>
<p>If at any time while you are enrolled, you do not send or receive money using the Transfer Service for a period of 18 consecutive months, we may contact you and/or take other steps to confirm that the U.S. mobile phone number or email address that you enrolled still belongs to you. If we are unable to confirm that you are the owner of the mobile phone number or email address, then you understand that we may cancel your enrollment and you will not be able to send or receive money with the Transfer Service until you enroll again.</p>
<p>Once enrolled, a Z logo may appear on your profile picture for each U.S. mobile number and/or email address that you have enrolled with <em>Zelle</em>. The Z logo may be displayed to other Members to aid them in determining which of your U.S. mobile numbers or email addresses should be used to send money with <em>Zelle</em>. If a Member sends you money using a different U.S. mobile number or email address that they may have for you (one that is not already enrolled), you will receive a message with instructions on how to enroll with <em>Zelle</em>.

<h3><a id="transfer-types" name="transfer-types"><span></span></a> 10.A. Types of Fund Transfers</h3>
<p>You may use the Transfer Service to perform Transfer Transactions.</p>
<p>We may from time to time make available additional or new features to the Transfer Service. You will be approved or declined for any such additional service at our sole discretion and additional terms and conditions may apply. We may at any time decline any Transfer Transaction that we believe may violate applicable law.</p>
<p>You represent and warrant to us that:</p>
<ul>
<li>all Transfer Transactions you initiate are for your own account, and not on behalf of another person,</li>
<li>you are not receiving any fee or compensation from any other person in return for initiating a Transfer Transaction, and</li>
<li>you are authorized by the receiving Member to make funds transfers to the Member’s account at the Member’s Financial institution.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a id="send-money" name="send-money"><span></span></a> 10.B. Sending Money; Debits by Participating Financial Institutions</h3>
<p>i. General Information</p>
<p>You may send money to another Member at your initiation or in response to that Member’s request for money. <strong>For your protection, you should only send money to people you know and trust.</strong> You understand that use of this Transfer Service by you shall at all times be subject to (i) this Addendum, and (ii) your express authorization at the time of the transaction for us to initiate a debit entry to your Funding Account. <strong>You understand that when you send the payment, you will generally have no ability to stop it. You may only cancel a payment if the person to whom you sent the money has not yet enrolled in the Transfer Service.</strong> If the person you sent money to has already enrolled with <em>Zelle</em>, either in the <em>Zelle</em> mobile app or with a Participating Financial Institution, the money is sent directly to their bank account (except as otherwise provided below) and may not be canceled or revoked.</p>
<p>ii. Timing of Transfer Transactions</p>
<p>In most cases, when you are sending money to another Member, the transfer will occur in minutes; however, there are circumstances when the payment may take longer. For example, in order to protect you, us, <em>Zelle</em> and the other Participating Financial Institutions, we may need additional time to verify your identity or the identity of the person receiving the money. </p>
<p>If you are sending money to someone who has not enrolled as a Member with <em>Zelle</em>, either in the <em>Zelle</em> mobile app or with a Participating Financial Institution, they will receive a text or email notification instructing them on how to enroll to receive the money. You understand and acknowledge that a person to whom you are sending money and who is not enrolling as a Member may fail to enroll with <em>Zelle</em>, or otherwise ignore the payment notification, and the transfer may not occur. </p>
<p>The money may also be delayed or the transfer may be blocked to prevent fraud or comply with regulatory requirements. If we delay or block a payment that you have initiated, we will notify you in accordance with your communication preferences (i.e., email, push notification, text message). </p>
<p>We have no control over the actions of other Members, other Participating Financial Institutions or other financial institutions that could delay or prevent your money from being delivered to the intended Member. </p>
<p>iii. Requirement for an Advanced Access Code </p>
<p>An Advanced Access code is required when you send money to a Member for the first time. We will send you a text message with an Advanced Access code to your mobile phone number on file. In most instances, we will be able to send you an Advanced Access code immediately; however, in some cases, there may be a delay in when you can initiate your transfer to a Member for the first time. </p>
<p>You can find additional information about Advanced Access here: <a href="../../../help/online-banking/advanced-access-faqs/index.html"><br></a></p>

<h3><a id="frequency" name="frequency"><span></span></a> 10.C. Frequency of Transfer Transactions</h3>
<p>We do not limit the number of transfers you may make; however, you may not make transfers in excess of the number of fund transfers allowed by the rules governing the applicable accounts. We may from time to time, for security and risk management reasons, modify the limit, the frequency, and the dollar amount of transfers you can make using the Transfer Service.</p>
<h3><a id="dollar-amount" name="dollar-amount"><span></span></a> 10.D. Dollar Amount of Transfer Transactions for Sending Money</h3>
<p>You may not make transfers in excess of the limits described below. The amount of money you can send will vary based on the type of Funding Account you use, your account and online banking history, your recipient, and the transaction history for each recipient. Transfers to established recipients from a Wells Fargo Bank Funding Account may be made up to a daily dollar limit of $3,500 and a 30-day rolling dollar limit of $20,000. Higher limits may apply in certain transactions or if you are using a Funding Account from Wells Fargo Advisors or The Private Bank. <strong>Please note the amount of money you can send a new recipient may be initially lower; however, we may adjust the transfer limit when you send subsequent payments to the same recipient.</strong> For more details on applicable limits, log in to the Transfer Service on Wells Fargo Online Banking (choose Send Money and select Transfer Limits) or Wells Fargo Mobile Banking (choose Send Money with <em>Zelle</em> and view the FAQs). </p>
<p>Transfer limits applicable to Members of other financial institutions are governed by the Member’s Financial Institution’s transfer service agreements. Transfer limits applicable to Members who use the separate <em>Zelle</em> transfer service website or mobile app are governed by <em>Zelle’s</em> separate transfer service agreements. </p>
<p>We reserve the right to change from time to time the dollar amount of transfers you are permitted to make using the Transfer Service without prior notice to you, unless otherwise required by applicable law or regulation. For example, in the event that your use of the Transfer Service has been suspended and reinstated, you understand and agree that your use of the Transfer Service thereafter may be subject to lower dollar amount limitations than would otherwise be permitted by us. All transfer limits are subject to temporary reductions to protect the security of customer accounts and/or the Transfer Service. Your transfer limits may vary from those of other Members, depending upon criteria we establish from time to time.</p>
<h3><a id="transfer-rules" name="transfer-rules"><span></span></a> 10.E. Transfer Transactions Subject to the Rules of the Funding Account</h3>
<p>All Transfer Transactions are subject to the rules and regulations governing your Funding Account. You agree not to initiate any payments from an account that are not allowed under the rules or regulations applicable to that account, including, without limitation, rules or regulations designed to prevent the transfer of funds in violation of OFAC regulations. You agree that any Transfer Transaction to a Member’s account which is not with a Participating Financial Institution will also be governed by the Nacha Operating Rules and any applicable card network rules (e.g. Visa or Mastercard).</p>
<h3><a id="transfer-descriptions" name="transfer-descriptions"><span></span></a> 10.F. Transfer Transaction Descriptions</h3>
<p>We may, in our sole discretion, permit you to add a description or comment concerning the Transfer Transaction that will be transmitted to the recipient. You agree that if we permit you to add a description or comment concerning the payment to your recipient that you will not include inappropriate or abusive language, emojis, messages or content in the description or comment. You agree that we may monitor the contents of the description or comment, and may delete or edit the message if we believe any of the content is inappropriate or abusive, in our sole and absolute discretion.</p>
<h3><a id="transaction-failure" name="transaction-failure"><span></span></a> 10.G. Failure or Rejection of Transfer Transactions</h3>
<p>We do not make any representation or warranty that any particular Transfer Transaction can be completed, or that it can be completed within a particular period of time. Any estimate we may provide concerning the completion date for the Transfer Transaction is only an estimate, and is not binding on us. You understand and agree that we have no control over the actions of other Members, or of other financial institutions (including Member’s Financial Institutions), that may prevent a Transfer Transaction from being completed, or may delay its completion. You understand and agree that we may not be able to complete a Transfer Transaction if: </p>
<ul>
<li>the receiving Member does not enroll with the Transfer Service; or, </li>
<li>the receiving Member does not enroll with the Transfer Service the specific email address or telephone number you have provided to us for them. </li>
</ul>
<p>Upon learning that a Transfer Transaction to transfer funds from your Funding Account to a Member cannot be completed for any reason, we may make a reasonable effort to complete the payment again. If the Transfer Transaction is not completed, we will notify you to contact your intended recipient. </p>
<p>If you do not have enough money in your Funding Account to make a Transfer Transaction, we may reject your request to initiate the Transfer Transaction. </p>
<p>We reserve the right to decline or cancel any payment instructions or orders or to carry out change or cancellation requests. We may, in our sole discretion, decline to initiate or complete a Transfer Transaction for any reason. We may, in our sole discretion, accept instructions from any Member or from a Member’s Financial Institution to block your attempts to use the Transfer Service to initiate Transfer Transactions with that Member or customers of that institution.</p>
<h3><a id="authorization-suspense" name="authorization-suspense"><span></span></a> 10.H. Authorization for Fund Transfer and Suspense of Funds</h3>
<p>You agree that each payment instruction you give us is an authorization to make a funds transfer on your behalf. You authorize us to withdraw the funds from your Funding Account immediately upon receiving your instruction for the Transfer Transaction and to place the funds in a suspense account pending completion of the Transfer Transaction. You understand and agree that in the case of a Transfer Transaction to a person who has not yet enrolled in the Transfer Service, or if your Funding Account has been open for less than thirty days, we may hold your funds in the suspense account for up to fifteen business days before either returning the funds to you or sending them to the recipient.</p>
<p>You also agree that the Member’s Financial Institution receiving the funds for a Transfer Transaction may hold those funds for a reasonable period of time while attempting to identify a Deposit Account for a Member who has either: </p>
<ul>
<li>not yet enrolled in the Transfer Service; </li>
<li>not yet identified a Deposit Account, or </li>
<li>closed the recipient’s prior Deposit Account but still has other accounts open with the Member’s Financial Institution. </li>
</ul>
<p>You understand that the Member’s Financial Institution receiving the funds may require a Member to manually accept each funds transfer you send to the Member. If the Member does not accept the funds transfer within the time frame set by the Member’s Financial Institution, the funds will be returned to you. <strong>You understand and agree that we have no control over whether or not the Member’s Financial Institution will require manual acceptance, or how long the Member’s Financial Institution will hold the funds before returning them.</strong> </p>
<p>You authorize us to act as your agent in receiving and processing any return of funds or Notification of Change received through the Automated Clearing House system.</p>
<h3><a id="no-right-cancel" name="no-right-cancel"><span></span></a> 10.I. No Right to Cancel or Stop a Transfer Transaction</h3>
<p>Transfer Transactions that have been processed cannot be cancelled or stopped. <strong>You agree that you, and not we, will be responsible for resolving any payment dispute with any Member to whom you send money through a Transfer Transaction,</strong> except as otherwise provided by law or regulation (including, to the extent applicable, the protections described in Section 13 relating to EFTs for consumer accounts).</p></div>

			<a name="processing-payments" id="processing-payments"><span></span></a>
			11.A. Payments to You from Other Members
		</h3>
		

		<p>i. General Information</p>
		

		<p>Once a Member initiates a transfer of money to your email address or mobile phone number enrolled with the Transfer Service, you have no ability to stop the transfer. By using the Transfer Service, you agree and authorize us to initiate credit entries to your Deposit Account.</p>
		

		<p>All fund transfers payments received are subject to the rules and regulations governing your Deposit Account.</p>
		

		<p>ii. Timing of Transfer Transactions</p>
		

		<p>Most transfers of money to you from other Members will occur within minutes. There may be other circumstances when the payment may take longer. For example, in order to protect you, us, <em>Zelle</em> and the other Participating Financial Institutions, we may need or <em>Zelle</em> may need additional time to verify your identity or the identity of the person sending the money. We may also delay or block the transfer to prevent fraud or to meet our regulatory obligations. If we delay or block a payment that you have initiated through a request for money, we will notify you in accordance with your communication preferences (i.e. email, push notification).</p>
		

		<p>In some cases, a Member, who is a business or government agency, may send payments to you using the email address or mobile phone number that you enroll. If you are receiving a payment from a business or government agency, your payment will be delivered in accordance with both this Addendum and the procedures of the business or government agency that is sending you the payment.</p>
		

		<p>iii. Dollar amount of Transfer Transactions for Receiving Money</p>
		

		<p>With some exceptions, as noted in this section, Wells Fargo does not set limits on the funds you can receive from other Members. However, for Wells Fargo account-based transactions, where a Wells Fargo Member transfers funds directly to your Deposit Account using your account number rather than your mobile phone number or email address, you can receive up to $10,000 per day, per account. In addition, the funds you can receive from another Member may be limited by applicable card network rules, the Member’s Financial Institution’s transfer service agreements or <em>Zelle</em>’s separate transfer service agreements.</p>
		

		<p>iv. Processing Transfer Transactions</p>
		

		<p>You agree that we may hold funds we receive on your behalf for a reasonable period of time while attempting to identify a Deposit Account if you have either:</p>
		

		<ul>
<li>not yet identified a Deposit Account, or</li>
<li>closed your prior Deposit Account but still have other accounts open with us.</li>
</ul>
		

		<p>We may return all or part of any Transfer Transaction to the sending financial institution, at any time and in our sole discretion, if either:</p>
		

		<ul>
<li>we are unable to establish that you are the intended recipient of the Transfer Transaction,</li>
<li>you do not enroll with the Transfer Service the specific email address or telephone number the sending Member has provided to us for you,</li>
<li>we reasonably believe that completing the Transfer Transaction would violate any applicable law or regulation,</li>
<li>the Member sending the funds has exceeded any of the sending limits established by the Member’s financial institution for Transfer Transactions,</li>
<li>you have exceeded or will, by receiving the pending Transfer Transaction, exceed any of your receiving limits for Transfer Transactions,</li>
<li>we are advised that either the Participating Financial Institution, the Member initiating the Transfer Transaction, or the owner of the Funding Account from which the payment was made, has alleged that the Transfer Transaction was fraudulent or unauthorized, or</li>
<li>you do not identify a Deposit Account within a reasonable time, not to exceed 14 calendar days, after you are sent notice of a pending Transfer Transaction.</li>
</ul>
		

		<h3>
			<a name="processing-refunding" id="processing-refunding"><span></span></a>
			11.B. Refunding Payments Made to You by Members
		</h3>
		

		<p>You agree that you are responsible for the full amount of any Transfer Transaction we credit to your Funding Account which is later reversed for any reason. You agree that we may withdraw the full amount, or any portion, of any reversed or disputed Transfer Transaction, plus any applicable fees, from your Funding Account or from any other account you have with us, without prior notice to you. You agree that you, and not we, will be responsible for resolving any payment dispute with any Member from whom you receive money through a Transfer Transaction.</p>
		

		<h3>
			<a name="processing-discharge" id="processing-discharge"><span></span></a>
			11.C. Discharge of Obligations
		</h3>
		

		<p>You understand and agree that the extent to which a Transfer Transaction discharges an underlying obligation you have to the recipient of a Transfer Transaction, or an underlying obligation owed to you by the sender of a Transfer Transaction, will be determined by your agreement with the other party and other applicable law.</p>

			 12.A. Requesting Money
		</h3>
		

		<p>We may, at our option, offer you the ability to send a request for money to another Member. You understand and agree that:</p>
		

		<ul>
<li>All requests for money must be delivered to an email address if a Member has not enrolled a mobile phone number with us, <em>Zelle</em> or a Participating Financial Institution.</li>
<li>Members to whom you send payment requests may reject or ignore your request. Neither we nor <em>Zelle</em> guarantee that you will receive money from other Members by sending a payment request, or that you will receive the amount that you request. Neither we nor <em>Zelle</em> accept responsibility if a Member rejects or ignores your request, or sends you an amount that is less than you request. If a Member ignores your request, we may decide or <em>Zelle</em> may decide, in our sole discretion, that we will not send a reminder or repeat request to that Member. We have no obligation to advise you on whether or not the request has been received.</li>
<li>You will not make or repeat a request for money to a Member after you have received notice from any person that either:
<ul>
<li>the Member does not wish to receive a request for money from you, or</li>
<li>the Member disputes or disclaims the obligation for which the request is made.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You agree that you are not engaging in the business of debt collection by attempting to use the Transfer Service to request money for the payment or collection of an overdue or delinquent debt; to request money that is owed to another person; or to collect any amounts that are owed pursuant to a court order. You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless us, <em>Zelle</em>, its owners, directors, officers, agents, and Participating Financial Institutions, from and against all claims, losses, expenses, damages and costs (including, but not limited to, direct, incidental, consequential, exemplary and indirect damages), and reasonable attorney's fees, resulting from or arising out of any request for money that you send that is related to overdue or delinquent amounts.</li>
<li>You agree to receive money requests from other Members, and to only send requests for legitimate and lawful purposes. Requests for money are solely between the sender and recipient and are not reviewed or verified by us or by <em>Zelle</em>. Neither we nor <em>Zelle</em> assume responsibility for the accuracy or legality of such requests and do not act as a debt collector on your behalf or on behalf of the sender of a request for money.</li>
<li>We reserve the right, but assume no obligation, to terminate your ability to send requests for money in general, or to specific recipients, if we deem such requests to be potentially unlawful, abusive, offensive or unwelcome by the recipient.</li>
<li>You may not have more than 30 pending requests at any one time.</li>
</ul>
		

		<h3>
			<a name="requesting-receiving" id="requesting-receiving"><span></span></a>
			 12.B. Receiving a Request for Money
		</h3>
		

		<p>We may offer other Members the ability to send you a request for money. You have no obligation to respond to the request, either through the Transfer Service or otherwise. You authorize us to deliver to you all requests made by other Members that we reasonably believe are addressed to you. You understand and agree that:</p>
		

		<ul>
<li>We are not able to control the frequency, content, or purpose of requests that may be sent to you by other Members.</li>
<li>We make no representations or warranties concerning the genuineness or accuracy of any request you receive.</li>

<h3><a name="electronic-applicability" id="electronic-applicability"><span></span></a> 13.A. Applicability</h3>
<p>The provisions in this Section apply only to electronic fund transfers (EFTs) that debit or credit a consumer's checking, savings, or other asset account and are subject to Regulation E, which implements the federal Electronic Fund Transfer Act. You can find the terms and conditions that apply to EFTs that debit or credit a brokerage account in your brokerage account agreement, not this Addendum.</p>
<p>When applicable, we may rely on any exceptions to the provisions in this Section that are covered in Regulation E. All terms in this Section not defined in this Addendum but defined in Regulation E will have the meaning given in Regulation E.</p>
<h3><a name="electronic-your" id="electronic-your"><span></span></a> 13.B. Your Liability for Unauthorized EFTs</h3>

<p>If your delay in notifying us was due to extenuating circumstances, we’ll extend the times specified in the immediately preceding paragraphs to a reasonable period.</p>
<p>Note that these liability rules are established by Regulation E, which implements the federal Electronic Fund Transfer Act and do not apply to business accounts.</p>
<h3><a name="electronic-in" id="electronic-in"><span></span></a> 13.C. In Case of Errors, Unauthorized EFTs, or Questions</h3>
<p>Here’s how to notify us when you believe that an error, unauthorized EFT, or unauthorized transfer has been or may have been made:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Phone.</strong> <strong><span class="c12">1-800-956-4442</span></strong>, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.</li>
<li><strong>Paper Mail.</strong> Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., P.O. Box 4132, Concord, CA 94518-4917.</li>
<li><strong>Online.</strong> Sign on to the Service with your username and password and use the appropriate form.</li>
</ul>
<p>To notify us of errors in brokerage account transfers, follow the procedures in your brokerage account agreement.</p>
<p>To limit your liability for subsequent unauthorized transfers, or to report any other errors, we must hear from you no later than 60 days after the date we send the first statement on which the problem or error appeared.</p>
<p>When contacting us about an error or with questions, please tell us:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your name and account number (if any).</li>
<li>About the error or the transfer you question, and clearly explain why you believe it is an error or why you need more information.</li>
<li>The dollar amount and date of the suspected error.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you report a problem by phone, we may ask you to submit your complaint or question in writing within 10 Business Days. We’ll determine whether an error occurred within 10 Business Days after we hear from you and will promptly correct any error. If we need more time to conduct our investigation, we’ll notify you of our need for an extension of up to 45 days. If we decide to do this, we’ll provisionally credit your account within 10 Business Days for the amount you think is in error, so you can use the money during the time it takes us to complete our investigation. If we ask you to put your complaint or question in writing and don’t receive it within 10 Business Days, we may not provisionally credit your account.</p>
<p>We may permit you to initiate or monitor the status of certain kinds of complaints or questions electronically on the Website. Complaints or questions you initiate via the process we provide on the Website will be considered as written notification.</p>
<p>For errors involving new accounts, our investigation may take up to 90 calendar days. For new accounts, we may take up to 20 Business Days to credit your account for the amount you think is in error.</p>
<p>We will tell you the results within three Business Days after completing our investigation. If we decide that there was no error, we will send you a written explanation and you can ask for copies of the documents that we used in our investigation.
<br /></p>
<h3><a name="electronic-documentation" id="electronic-documentation"><span></span></a> 13.D. Documentation</h3>
<p>You have the right to find out whether an EFT was credited to or debited from your Wells Fargo account. Please contact the Wells Fargo Phone Bank at the number listed on your statement for your Wells Fargo Account. We will send you a monthly statement if there is an EFT in a particular month. Otherwise, we will send you a statement at least quarterly.</p>
<p>You may also access a history of all fund transfers completed or pending at any time by viewing your account activity or statements.</p>
<h3><a name="electronic-our" id="electronic-our"><span></span></a> 13.E. Our Liability to You</h3>
<p>If we do not complete a Transfer Transaction to or from your account on time or in the correct amount according to our agreement with you, we will be liable for your losses or damages. However, there are some exceptions. For instance, we will not be liable if:</p>
<ul>
<li>Through no fault of ours, you do not have enough money in your account
<ul>
<li>to make the transfer,</li>
<li>The transfer would go over the credit limit on a credit account linked for overdraft protection,</li>
<li>The Transfer Service was not working properly and you knew about the breakdown when you started the transfer,</li>
<li>Circumstances beyond our control (such as fire or flood) prevent the transfer, despite reasonable precautions we have taken, or</li>
<li>There is some other exception stated in any of our agreements with you.</li>
